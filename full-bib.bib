	abstract = {The presence of tunnels in protein structures substantially influences their reactivity with other molecules. Therefore, studying their properties and changes over time has been in the scope of biochemists for decades. In this paper we introduce a novel approach for the comparative visualization and exploration of ensembles of tunnels. Our goal is to overcome occlusion problems with traditional tunnel representations while providing users a quick way to navigate through the input dataset and to identify potentially interesting tunnels. First, we unfold the input tunnels to a 2D representation enabling to observe the mutual position of amino acids forming the tunnel surface and the amount of surface they influence. These 2D images are subsequently described by image moments commonly used in image processing. This way we are able to detect similarities and outliers in the dataset, which are visualized as clusters in a scatterplot graph. The same coloring scheme is used in the linked bar chart enabling to detect the position of the cluster members over time. These views provide a way to select a subset of potentially interesting tunnels that can be further explored in detail using the 2D unfolded view and also traditional 3D representation. The usability of our approach is demonstrated by case studies conducted by domain experts.},

	abstract = {A challenging problem in biology is the incompleteness of acquired information when visualizing biological phenomena. Structural biology generates detailed models of viruses or bacteria at different development stages, while the processes that relate one stage to another are often not clear. Similarly, the entire life cycle of a biological entity might be available as a quantitative model, while only one structural model is available. If the relation between two models is speciﬁed at a lower level of detail than the actual models themselves, the two models cannot be interpolated correctly. We propose a method that deals with the visualization of incomplete data information in the developmental or evolutionary states of biological mesoscale models, such as viruses or microorganisms. The central tool in our approach is visual abstraction. Instead of directly interpolating between two models that show different states of an organism, we gradually forward transform the models into a level of visual abstraction that matches the level of detail of the modeled relation between them. At this level, the models can be interpolated without conveying false information. After the interpolation to the new state, we apply the inverse transformation to the model’s original level of abstraction. To show the ﬂexibility of our approach, we demonstrate our method on the basis of molecular data, in particular data of the {HIV} virion and the mycoplasma bacterium.},

	abstract = {Magnetic Resonance Imaging ({MRI}) enables volumetric and time-varying measurements of blood-ﬂow data. Such data have shown potential to improve diagnosis and risk assessment of various cardiovascular diseases. Hereby, a unique way of analysing patient-speciﬁc haemodynamics becomes possible. However, these measurements are susceptible to artifacts, noise and a coarse spatio-temporal resolution. Furthermore, typical ﬂow visualization techniques rely on interpolation. For example, using pathlines requires a high quality temporal resolution. While numerical simulations, based on mathematical ﬂow models, address some of these limitations, the involved modelling assumptions (e.g., regarding the inﬂow and mesh) do not provide patientspeciﬁc data to the degree actual measurements would. To overcome this issue, data assimilation techniques can be applied to use measured data in order to steer a physically-based simulation of the ﬂow, combining the beneﬁts of measured data and simulation. Our work builds upon such an existing solution to increase the temporal resolution of the measured data, but achieves signiﬁcantly higher ﬁdelity. We avoid the previous damping and interpolation bias towards one of the measurements, by simulating bidrectionally (forwards and backwards through time) and using sources and sinks. Our method is evaluated and compared to the, currently-used, conventional interpolation scheme and forward-only simulation using measured and analytical ﬂow data. It reduces artifacts, noise, and interpolation error, while being closer to laminar ﬂow, as is expected for ﬂow in vessels.},

	abstract = {Cardiac ﬂow is still not fully understood, and is currently an active research topic. Using phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging ({PC}-{MRI}) blood ﬂow can be measured. For the inspection of such ﬂow, researchers often rely on methods that require additional scans produced by different imaging modalities to provide context. This requires labor-intensive registration and often manual segmentation before any exploration of the data is performed. This work provides a framework that allows for a quick exploration of cardiac ﬂow without the need of additional imaging and time-consuming segmentation. To achieve this, only the 4D data from one {PC}-{MRI} scan is used. A context visualization is derived automatically from the data, and provides context for the ﬂow. Instead of relying on segmentation to deliver an accurate context, the heart’s ventricles are approximated by half-ellipsoids that can be placed with minimal user interaction. Furthermore, seeding positions for ﬂow visualization can be placed automatically in areas of interest deﬁned by the user and based on derived ﬂow features. The framework enables a user to do a fast initial exploration of cardiac ﬂow, as is demonstrated by a use case and a user study involving cardiac blood ﬂow researchers.},

To understand what causes or deteriorates a disease and identify related biomarkers, clinical researchers regularly perform large-scale cohort studies, requiring the comparison of such data at cellular level. In such studies, with little a-priori knowledge of what to expect in the data, explorative data analysis is a necessity. Here, we present an interactive visual analysis workflow for the comparison of cohorts of spatially-resolved omics-data. Our workflow allows the comparative analysis of two cohorts based on multiple levels-of-detail, from simple abundance of contained cell types over complex co-localization patterns to individual comparison of complete tissue images. As a result, the workflow enables the identification of cohort-differentiating features, as well as outlier samples at any stage of the workflow. During the development of the workflow, we continuously consulted with domain experts. To show the effectiveness of the workflow, we conducted multiple case studies with domain experts from different application areas and with different data modalities.},

This model can be applied to a wide range of real-world data sets. Examples of multilayer networks can be found in the domains of life sciences, sociology, digital humanities and more. Within the domain of graph visualization, there are many systems which visualize data sets having many characteristics of multilayer graphs. This report provides a state of the art and a structured analysis of contemporary multilayer network visualization, not only for researchers in visualization, but also for those who aim to visualize multilayer networks in the domain of complex systems, as well as those developing systems across application domains. We have explored the visualization literature to survey visualization techniques suitable for multilayer graph visualization, as well as tools, tasks and analytic techniques from within application domains.

	abstract = {Key points Optogenetics-based defibrillation, a theoretical alternative to electrotherapy, involves expression of light-sensitive ion channels in the heart (via gene or cell therapy) and illumination of the cardiac surfaces (via implanted {LED} arrays) to elicit light-induced activations. We used a biophysically detailed human ventricular model to determine whether such a therapy could terminate fibrillation ({VF}) and identify which combinations of light-sensitive ion channel properties and illumination configurations would be effective. Defibrillation was successful when a large proportion ({\textgreater} 16.6\%) of ventricular tissue was directly stimulated by light that was bright enough to induce an action potential in an uncoupled cell. While illumination with blue light never successfully terminated {VF}, illumination of red light-sensitive ion channels with dense arrays of implanted red light sources resulted in successful defibrillation. Our results suggest that cardiac expression of red light-sensitive ion channels is necessary for the development of effective optogenetics-based defibrillation therapy using {LED} arrays. Abstract Optogenetics-based defibrillation has been proposed as a novel and potentially pain-free approach to enable cardiomyocyte-selective defibrillation in humans, but the feasibility of such a therapy remains unknown. This study aimed to (1) assess the feasibility of terminating sustained ventricular fibrillation ({VF}) via light-induced excitation of opsins expressed throughout the myocardium and (2) identify the ideal (theoretically possible) opsin properties and light source configurations that would maximise therapeutic efficacy. We conducted electrophysiological simulations in an {MRI}-based human ventricular model with {VF} induced by rapid pacing; light sensitisation via systemic, cardiac-specific gene transfer of channelrhodopsin-2 ({ChR}2) was simulated. In addition to the widely used blue light-sensitive {ChR}2-H134R, we also modelled theoretical {ChR}2 variants with augmented light sensitivity ({ChR}2+), red-shifted spectral sensitivity ({ChR}2-{RED}) or both ({ChR}2-{RED}+). Light sources were modelled as synchronously activating {LED} arrays ({LED} radius: 1 mm; optical power: 10 {mW} mm–2; array density: 1.15–4.61 cm–2). For each unique optogenetic configuration, defibrillation was attempted with two different optical pulse durations (25 and 500 ms). {VF} termination was only successful for configurations involving {ChR}2-{RED} and {ChR}2-{RED}+ (for {LED} arrays with density ≥ 2.30 cm–2), suggesting that opsin spectral sensitivity was the most important determinant of optogenetic defibrillation efficacy. This was due to the deeper penetration of red light in cardiac tissue compared with blue light, which resulted in more widespread light-induced propagating wavefronts. Longer pulse duration and higher {LED} array density were associated with increased optogenetic defibrillation efficacy. In all cases observed, the defibrillation mechanism was light-induced depolarisation of the excitable gap, which led to block of reentrant wavefronts.},

We thus sample trajectories of the stochastic process described by the chemical master equation with time-varying propensities. A comparative analysis shows that existing approaches can either fail dramatically, or else can impose impractical computational burdens due to numerical integration of reaction propensities, especially when cell ensembles are studied. Here we introduce the Extrande method which, given a simulated time course of dynamic network inputs, provides a conditionally exact and several orders-of-magnitude faster simulation solution. The new approach makes it feasible to demonstrate—using decision-making by a large population of quorum sensing bacteria—that robustness to fluctuations from upstream signaling places strong constraints on the design of networks determining cell fate. Our approach has the potential to significantly advance both understanding of molecular systems biology and design of synthetic circuits.},

	abstract = {Bioengineering analyses of physiological systems use the computational solution of physical conservation laws on anatomically detailed geometric models to understand the physiological function of intact organs in terms of the properties and behaviour of the cells and tissues within the organ. By linking behaviour in a quantitative, mathematically defined sense across multiple scales of biological organization – from proteins to cells, tissues, organs and organ systems – these methods have the potential to link patient-specific knowledge at the two ends of these spatial scales. A genetic profile linked to cardiac ion channel mutations, for example, can be interpreted in relation to body surface {ECG} measurements via a mathematical model of the heart and torso, which includes the spatial distribution of cardiac ion channels throughout the myocardium and the individual kinetics for each of the approximately 50 types of ion channel, exchanger or pump known to be present in the heart. Similarly, linking molecular defects such as mutations of chloride ion channels in lung epithelial cells to the integrated function of the intact lung requires models that include the detailed anatomy of the lungs, the physics of air flow, blood flow and gas exchange, together with the large deformation mechanics of breathing. Organizing this large body of knowledge into a coherent framework for modelling requires the development of ontologies, markup languages for encoding models, and web-accessible distributed databases. In this article we review the state of the field at all the relevant levels, and the tools that are being developed to tackle such complexity. Integrative physiology is central to the interpretation of genomic and proteomic data, and is becoming a highly quantitative, computer-intensive discipline.},

A challenge will be combining these heterogeneous tissue samples into a 3D reference map that will enable multiscale, multidimensional Google Maps-like exploration of the human body. Key to making alignment of tissue samples work is identifying and using a coordinate system called a Common Coordinate Framework ({CCF}), which defines the positions, or "addresses," in a reference body, from whole organs down to functional tissue units and individual cells.

The Biochemical Literacy Framework ({BCLF}) aspires to encourage innovative course design in both the biochemical field and beyond through stimulating discussion among individuals developing undergraduate biochemistry degree courses based on pedagogical best practice. Here, we examine the concept of biochemical literacy aiming to start answering the question: What must individuals do and know to approach and transform ideas in the context of the biochemical sciences? The {BCLF} began with the guidance published by relevant learned societies - including the Royal Society of Biology, the Biochemical Society, the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and the Quality Assurance Agency, before considering relevant pedagogical literature. We propose that biochemical literacy is comprised of seven key skills: critical thinking, self-management, communication, information literacy, visual literacy, practical skills and content knowledge. Together, these form a dynamic, highly interconnected and interrelated meta-literacy supporting the use of evidence-based, robust learning techniques.

	abstract = {Advancing from two core traits of biological systems: multilevel network organization and nonlinearity, we review a host of novel and readily available techniques to explore and analyze their complex dynamic behavior within the framework of experimental–computational synergy. In the context of concrete biological examples, analytical methods such as wavelet, power spectra, and metabolomics–fluxomics analyses, are presented, discussed, and their strengths and limitations highlighted. Further shown is how time series from stationary and nonstationary biological variables and signals, such as membrane potential, high-throughput metabolomics, O2 and {CO}2 levels, bird locomotion, at the molecular, (sub)cellular, tissue, and whole organ and animal levels, can reveal important information on the properties of the underlying biological networks. Systems biology-inspired computational methods start to pave the way for addressing the integrated functional dynamics of metabolic, organelle and organ networks. As our capacity to unravel the control and regulatory properties of these networks and their dynamics under normal or pathological conditions broadens, so is our ability to address endogenous rhythms and clocks to improve health-span in human aging, and to manage complex metabolic disorders, neurodegeneration, and cancer. {WIREs} Syst Biol Med 2017, 9:e1352. doi: 10.1002/wsbm.1352 This article is categorized under: Analytical and Computational Methods {\textgreater} Computational Methods Laboratory Methods and Technologies {\textgreater} Metabolomics Physiology {\textgreater} Physiology of Model Organisms},

However, current spatial transcriptomics methods either average local contexts or are restricted to limited fields of view. Here, we introduce sci-Space, which retains single-cell resolution while resolving spatial heterogeneity at larger scales. Applying sci-Space to developing mouse embryos, we captured approximate spatial coordinates and whole transcriptomes of about 120,000 nuclei. We identify thousands of genes exhibiting anatomically patterned expression, leverage spatial information to annotate cellular subtypes, show that cell types vary substantially in their extent of spatial patterning, and reveal correlations between pseudotime and the migratory patterns of differentiating neurons. Looking forward, we anticipate that sci-Space will facilitate the construction of spatially resolved single-cell atlases of mammalian development.},

The most challenging diseases, those with the largest socioeconomic impact (cardiovascular conditions; musculoskeletal conditions; cancer; metabolic, immunity, and neurodegenerative conditions), are all characterized by a complex genotype–phenotype interaction and by a “systemic” nature that poses a challenge to the traditional reductionist approach. In 2005 a small group of researchers discussed how the vision of computational physiology promoted by the Physiome Project could be translated into clinical practice and formally proposed the term Virtual Physiological Human. Our knowledge about these diseases is fragmentary, as it is associated with molecular and cellular processes on the one hand and with tissue and organ phenotype changes (related to clinical symptoms of disease conditions) on the other. The problem could be solved if we could capture all these fragments of knowledge into predictive models and then compose them into hypermodels that help us tame the complexity that such systemic behavior involves. In 2005 this was simply not possible—the necessary methods and technologies were not available. Now, 10 years later, it seems the right time to reflect on the original vision, the results achieved so far, and what remains to be done.},

This review will emphasize the value of applying computational approaches to advance our understanding of the underlying mechanisms and effects of microvascular remodelling. Examples of individual computational models applied to each of the scales will highlight the potential of answering specific questions that cannot be answered using typical biological experimentation alone.

Freely available open source computational modelling software is also being developed to solve the partial differential equations described by the models and to visualise results. The {OpenCMISS} code (opencmiss.org), described here, has been developed by the authors over the last six years to replace the {CMISS} code that has supported a number of organ system Physiome projects. {OpenCMISS} is designed to encompass multiple sets of physical equations and to link subcellular and tissue-level biophysical processes into organ-level processes. In the Heart Physiome project, for example, the large deformation mechanics of the myocardial wall need to be coupled to both ventricular flow and embedded coronary flow, and the reaction-diffusion equations that govern the propagation of electrical waves through myocardial tissue need to be coupled with equations that describe the ion channel currents that flow through the cardiac cell membranes. In this paper we discuss the design principles and distributed memory architecture behind the {OpenCMISS} code. We also discuss the design of the interfaces that link the sets of physical equations across common boundaries (such as fluid-structure coupling), or between spatial fields over the same domain (such as coupled electromechanics), and the concepts behind {CellML} and {FieldML} that are embodied in the {OpenCMISS} data structures. We show how all of these provide a flexible infrastructure for combining models developed across the {VPH}/Physiome community.},

Scientists can no longer interact directly with the huge amount of available data. However, future breakthroughs in biology depend on this interaction.

The concepts underlying our approach are based on navigation and visualization with zooming, semantic zooming and portals; and on data transformation via magic lenses. We think that these new visualization and navigation techniques should be applied globally to a federation of biological databases. {RESULTS}: We have implemented a generic tool, called Zomit, that provides an application programming interface for developing servers for such navigation and visualization, and a generic architecture-independent client (Javatrade mark applet) that queries such servers. As an illustration of the capabilities of our approach, we have developed {ZoomMap}, a prototype browser for the {HuGeMap} human genome map database. {AVAILABILITY}: Zomit and {ZoomMap} are available at the {URL} http://www.infobiogen.fr/services/zomit.},

For this purpose, data are collected to identify trends in human health, to derive hypotheses, e.g. related to risk factors, and to get insights in the data and the underlying phenomena. Most public health data have a temporal character. Moreover, the spatial character, e.g. spatial clustering of diseases, needs to be considered for decision-making. Visual analytics techniques involve (subspace) clustering, interaction techniques to identify relevant subpopulations, e.g. being particularly vulnerable to diseases, imputation of missing values, visual queries as well as visualization and interaction techniques for spatio-temporal data. We describe requirements, tasks and visual analytics techniques that are widely used in public health before going into detail with respect to applications. These include outbreak surveillance and epidemiology research, e.g. cancer epidemiology. We classify the solutions based on the visual analytics techniques employed.

	abstract = {Visualization and visual analysis play important roles in exploring, analyzing, and presenting scientific data. In many disciplines, data and model scenarios are becoming multifaceted: data are often spatiotemporal and multivariate; they stem from different data sources (multimodal data), from multiple simulation runs (multirun/ensemble data), or from multiphysics simulations of interacting phenomena (multimodel data resulting from coupled simulation models). Also, data can be of different dimensionality or structured on various types of grids that need to be related or fused in the visualization. This heterogeneity of data characteristics presents new opportunities as well as technical challenges for visualization research. Visualization and interaction techniques are thus often combined with computational analysis. In this survey, we study existing methods for visualization and interactive visual analysis of multifaceted scientific data. Based on a thorough literature review, a categorization of approaches is proposed. We cover a wide range of fields and discuss to which degree the different challenges are matched with existing solutions for visualization and visual analysis. This leads to conclusions with respect to promising research directions, for instance, to pursue new solutions for multirun and multimodel data as well as techniques that support a multitude of facets.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: We propose a general approach to the analysis of multivariate health outcome data where geo-coding at different spatial scales is available. We propose multiscale joint models which address the links between individual outcomes and also allow for correlation between areas. The models are highly novel in that they exploit survey data to provide multiscale estimates of the prevalences in small areas for a range of disease outcomes. Results The models incorporate both disease specific, and common disease spatially structured components. The multiple scales envisaged is where individual survey data is used to model regional prevalences or risks at an aggregate scale. This approach involves the use of survey weights as predictors within our Bayesian multivariate models. Missingness has to be addressed within these models and we use predictive inference which exploits the correlation between diseases to provide estimates of missing prevalances. The Case study we examine is from the National Health Survey of Chile where geocoding to Province level is available. In that survey, diabetes, Hypertension, obesity and elevated low-density cholesterol ({LDL}) are available but differential missingness requires that aggregation of estimates and also the assumption of smoothed sampling weights at the aggregate level. Conclusions: The methodology proposed is highly novel and flexibly handles multiple disease outcomes at individual and aggregated levels (i.e., multiscale joint models). The missingness mechanism adopted provides realistic estimates for inclusion in the aggregate model at Provincia level. The spatial structure of four diseases within Provincias has marked spatial differentiation, with diabetes and hypertension strongly clustered in central Provincias and obesity and {LDL} more clustered in the southern areas.},

	title = {Visualization and Exploration of Transcriptomics Data},
	abstract = {During the last decade, high-throughput analysis of transcriptomes with
microarrays and other technologies has become increasingly mature and
affordable, which has led to rapid growth of the number and size of available transcriptomics data sets. This in turn has created new challenges
for bioinformatics to provide adequate methods for data exploration and
visualization, which are the topic of this dissertation.
The first research question that I address is the efficient retrieval of
transcriptomics data sets from large databases, which is motivated by the
rapid growth of public repositories for transcriptomics data. This makes
the exploration of such repositories increasingly challenging, but also provides opportunities for biological discovery. I describe a knowledgedriven approach for exploration of transcriptomics data repositories based
on ontology visualization and data-driven approaches based on gene set
enrichment analysis and generative probabilistic models.
The second research question of this dissertation deals with the visualization of large transcriptomics data sets. This work has been driven
by the observation that there is a growing number of data sets with hundreds or thousands of samples but a lack of suitable methods to visualize
such data sets. To address this problem, I first present an analysis of the
visualization tasks in this context, and then describe the design of an interactive visualization method based on pixel-oriented visualizations and
tree maps. This design study is complemented with a description of the
implementation of the method and a discussion of practical aspects that
need to be taken into account when visualizing data sets of such scale.
This dissertation includes several case studies in which I describe
the application of the proposed methods to a range of real-world data sets
and discuss my findings.},

Gosling balances expressiveness for comprehensive multi-scale genomics data visualizations with accessibility for domain scientists. Our accompanying {JavaScript} toolkit called Gosling.js provides scalable and interactive rendering. Gosling.js is built on top of an existing platform for web-based genomics data visualization to further simplify the visualization of common genomics data formats. We demonstrate the expressiveness of the grammar through a variety of real-world examples. Furthermore, we show how Gosling supports the design of novel genomics visualizations.

Time-series analysis is still an open problem which prompts new solutions, particularly the discovery of patterns across complex temporal networks. Visualization has proven to be a valuable tool in the analysis of such datasets, with the emergence of new models such as Time Curves, which distorts timelines to position time points based on their similarity, creating visualizations that highlight behavior patterns. In this paper, we further explore time-series functionally and aesthetically by revising the dynamic Time Curves models in {CroP}, a visualization tool with coordinated multiple views. Firstly, we propose the additional of new visual elements and interactive functions, coordinated with a network visualization to help discover and understand temporal patterns across complex datasets. Secondly, we visually explore time-series through Time Paths, a parameter-based force-directed layout that can dynamically transform the original model to either highlight small data variations or reduce visual noise in favor of overall patterns.},

	abstract = {Motivation With the advancement of sequencing technologies, genomic data sets are constantly being expanded by high volumes of different data types. One recently introduced data type in genomic science is genomic signals, which are usually short-read coverage measurements over the genome. An example of genomic signals is Epigenomic marks which are utilized to locate functional and nonfunctional elements in genome annotation studies. To understand and evaluate the results of such studies, one needs to understand and analyze the characteristics of the input data.
Results {SigTools} is an R-based genomic signals visualization package developed with two objectives: 1) to facilitate genomic signals exploration in order to uncover insights for later model training, refinement, and development by including distribution and autocorrelation plots. 2) to enable genomic signals interpretation by including correlation, and aggregation plots. Moreover, Sigtools also provides text-based descriptive statistics of the given signals which can be practical when developing and evaluating learning models. We also include results from 2 case studies. The first examines several previously studied genomic signals called histone modifications. This use case demonstrates how {SigTools} can be beneficial for satisfying scientists’ curiosity in exploring and establishing recognized datasets. The second use case examines a dataset of novel chromatin state features which are novel genomic signals generated by a learning model. This use case demonstrates how {SigTools} can assist in exploring the characteristics and behavior of novel signals towards their interpretation. In addition, our corresponding web application, {SigTools}-Shiny, extends the accessibility scope of these modules to people who are more comfortable working with graphical user interfaces instead of command-line tools.

	abstract = {Large-scale sequencing techniques to chart genomes are entirely consolidated. Stable computational methods to perform primary tasks such as quality control, read mapping, peak calling, and counting are likewise available. However, there is a lack of uniform standards for graphical data mining, which is also of central importance. To fill this gap, we developed {SeqCode}, an open suite of applications that analyzes sequencing data in an elegant but efficient manner. Our software is a portable resource written in {ANSI} C that can be expected to work for almost all genomes in any computational configuration. Furthermore, we offer a user-friendly front-end web server that integrates {SeqCode} functions with other graphical analysis tools. Our analysis and visualization toolkit represents a significant improvement in terms of performance and usability as compare to other existing programs. Thus, {SeqCode} has the potential to become a key multipurpose instrument for high-throughput professional analysis; further, it provides an extremely useful open educational platform for the world-wide scientific community. {SeqCode} website is hosted at http://ldicrocelab.crg.eu, and the source code is freely distributed at https://github.com/eblancoga/seqcode.},

	abstract = {Molecular profiling of patient tumors and liquid biopsies over time with next-generation sequencing technologies and new immuno-profile assays are becoming part of standard research and clinical practice. With the wealth of new longitudinal data, there is a critical need for visualizations for cancer researchers to explore and interpret temporal patterns not just in a single patient but across cohorts. To address this need we developed {OncoThreads}, a tool for the visualization of longitudinal clinical and cancer genomics and other molecular data in patient cohorts. The tool visualizes patient cohorts as temporal heatmaps and Sankey diagrams that support the interactive exploration and ranking of a wide range of clinical and molecular features. This allows analysts to discover temporal patterns in longitudinal data, such as the impact of mutations on response to a treatment, e.g. emergence of resistant clones. We demonstrate the functionality of {OncoThreads} using a cohort of 23 glioma patients sampled at 2-4 timepoints. {OncoThreads} is freely available at http://oncothreads.gehlenborglab.org and implemented in Javascript using the {cBioPortal} web {API} as a backend.},

	abstract = {We present Multiscale Unfolding, an interactive technique for illustratively visualizing multiple hierarchical scales of {DNA} in a single view, showing the genome at different scales and demonstrating how one scale spatially folds into the next. The {DNA}'s extremely long sequential structure---arranged differently on several distinct scale levels---is often lost in traditional 3D depictions, mainly due to its multiple levels of dense spatial packing and the resulting occlusion. Furthermore, interactive exploration of this complex structure is cumbersome, requiring visibility management like cutaways. In contrast to existing temporally controlled multiscale data exploration, we allow viewers to always see and interact with any of the involved scales. For this purpose we separate the depiction into constant-scale and scale transition zones. Constant-scale zones maintain a single-scale representation, while still linearly unfolding the {DNA}. Inspired by illustration, scale transition zones connect adjacent constant-scale zones via level unfolding, scaling, and transparency. We thus represent the spatial structure of the whole {DNA} macro-molecule, maintain its local organizational characteristics, linearize its higher-level organization, and use spatially controlled, understandable interpolation between neighboring scales. We also contribute interaction techniques that provide viewers with a coarse-to-fine control for navigating within our all-scales-in-one-view representations and visual aids to illustrate the size differences. Overall, Multiscale Unfolding allows viewers to grasp the {DNA}'s structural composition from chromosomes to the atoms, with increasing levels of "unfoldedness," and can be applied in data-driven illustration and communication.},

	abstract = {Motivation The increasing amount of data produced by omics technologies has significantly improved the understanding of how biological information is transferred across different omics layers and to which extent it is involved in the manifestation of a given phenotype. Besides data-driven analysis strategies, interactive visualization tools have been developed to make the analysis in the multi-omics field more transparent. However, most state-of-the-art tools do not reconstruct the impact of a given omics layer on the final integration result. In general, the amount of omics data analyses strategies and the fields of applications lack a clearer classification of the different approaches.
Results We developed a classification for omics data focusing on different aspects of multi-omics data sets, such as data type and experimental design. Based on this classification we developed the Omics Trend-comparing Interactive Data Explorer ({OmicsTIDE}), an interactive visualization tool developed to address the limitations of current visualization approaches in the multi-omics field. The tool consists of an automated part that clusters omics data to determine trends and an interactive visualization. The trends are visualized as profile plots and are connected by a Sankey diagram that allows an interactive pairwise trend comparison to discover concordant and discordant trends. Moreover, large-scale omics data sets are broken down into small subsets of concordant and discordant regulatory trends within few analysis steps. We demonstrate the interactive analysis using {OmicsTIDE} with two case studies focusing on different types of experimental designs.

However, the development of anastomotic Intimal Hyperplasia ({IH}) and restenosis can compromise the medium-and-long term effects of the {CABG}. This problem can be correlated with the geometric configuration and hemodynamics of the bypass graft. A novel geometric configuration was proposed for the {CABG} with two symmetrically implanted grafts for the purpose of improving the hemodynamics. Physiological blood flows in two models of bypass grafts were simulated using numerical methods. One model was for the conventional bypass configuration with a single graft (1-way model); the other model was for the proposed bypass configuration with two grafts (2-way model). The temporal and spatial distributions of hemodynamics, such as flow patterns and Wall Shear Stress ({WSS}) in the vicinity of the distal anastomoses, were analyzed and compared. Calculation results showed that the 2-way model possessed favorable hemodynamics with uniform longitudinal flow patterns and {WSS} distributions, which could decrease the probability of restenosis and improve the effect of the surgical treatment. Concerning the limitations of the 2-way bypass grafts, it is necessary to perform animal experiments to verify the viability of this novel idea for the {CABG}.},

We introduce a taxonomy of elementary space-time cube operations and explain how these operations can be combined and parameterized. The generalized space-time cube has two properties: (1) it is purely conceptual without the need to be implemented, and (2) it applies to all datasets that can be represented in two dimensions plus time (e.g. geo-spatial, videos, networks, multivariate data). The proper choice of space-time cube operations depends on many factors, for example, density or sparsity of a cube. Hence, we propose a characterization of structures within space-time cubes, which allows us to discuss strengths and limitations of operations. We finally review interactive systems that support multiple operations, allowing a user to customize his view on the data. With this framework, we hope to facilitate the description, criticism and comparison of temporal data visualizations, as well as encourage the exploration of new techniques and systems. This paper is an extension of Bach et al.'s (2014) work.},

	abstract = {{OpenCMISS} is an open-source modeling environment aimed, in particular, at the solution of bioengineering problems. {OpenCMISS} consists of two main parts: a computational library ({OpenCMISS}-Iron) and a field manipulation and visualization library ({OpenCMISS}-Zinc). {OpenCMISS} is designed for the solution of coupled multi-scale, multi-physics problems in a general-purpose parallel environment. {CellML} is an {XML} format designed to encode biophysically based systems of ordinary differential equations and both linear and non-linear algebraic equations. A primary design goal of {CellML} is to allow mathematical models to be encoded in a modular and reusable format to aid reproducibility and interoperability of modeling studies. In {OpenCMISS}, we make use of {CellML} models to enable users to configure various aspects of their multi-scale physiological models. This avoids the need for users to be familiar with the {OpenCMISS} internal code in order to perform customized computational experiments. Examples of this are: cellular electrophysiology models embedded in tissue electrical propagation models; material constitutive relationships for mechanical growth and deformation simulations; time-varying boundary conditions for various problem domains; and fluid constitutive relationships and lumped-parameter models. In this paper, we provide implementation details describing how {CellML} models are integrated into multi-scale physiological models in {OpenCMISS}. The external interface {OpenCMISS} presents to users is also described, including specific examples exemplifying the extensibility and usability these tools provide the physiological modeling and simulation community. We conclude with some thoughts on future extension of {OpenCMISS} to make use of other community developed information standards, such as {FieldML}, {SED}-{ML}, and {BioSignalML}. Plans for the integration of accelerator code (graphical processing unit and field programmable gate array) generated from {CellML} models is also discussed.},

	abstract = {This survey gives an overview of the current state of the art in {GPU} techniques for interactive large-scale volume visualization. Modern techniques in this field have brought about a sea change in how interactive visualization and analysis of giga-, tera- and petabytes of volume data can be enabled on {GPUs}. In addition to combining the parallel processing power of {GPUs} with out-of-core methods and data streaming, a major enabler for interactivity is making both the computational and the visualization effort proportional to the amount and resolution of data that is actually visible on screen, i.e. ‘output-sensitive’ algorithms and system designs. This leads to recent output-sensitive approaches that are ‘ray-guided’, ‘visualization-driven’ or ‘display-aware’. In this survey, we focus on these characteristics and propose a new categorization of {GPU}-based large-scale volume visualization techniques based on the notions of actual output-resolution visibility and the current working set of volume bricks—the current subset of data that is minimally required to produce an output image of the desired display resolution. Furthermore, we discuss the differences and similarities of different rendering and data traversal strategies in volume rendering by putting them into a common context—the notion of address translation. For our purposes here, we view parallel (distributed) visualization using clusters as an orthogonal set of techniques that we do not discuss in detail but that can be used in conjunction with what we present in this survey.},

	abstract = {Multi-modal data of the complex human anatomy contain a wealth of information. To visualize and explore such data, techniques for emphasizing important structures and controlling visibility are essential. Such fused overview visualizations guide physicians to suspicious regions to be analysed in detail, e.g. with slice-based viewing. We give an overview of state of the art in multi-modal medical data visualization techniques. Multi-modal medical data consist of multiple scans of the same subject using various acquisition methods, often combining multiple complimentary types of information. Three-dimensional visualization techniques for multi-modal medical data can be used in diagnosis, treatment planning, doctor–patient communication as well as interdisciplinary communication. Over the years, multiple techniques have been developed in order to cope with the various associated challenges and present the relevant information from multiple sources in an insightful way. We present an overview of these techniques and analyse the specific challenges that arise in multi-modal data visualization and how recent works aimed to solve these, often using smart visibility techniques. We provide a taxonomy of these multi-modal visualization applications based on the modalities used and the visualization techniques employed. Additionally, we identify unsolved problems as potential future research directions.},
