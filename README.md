_Abstract_:
Physiology describes the fundamental science of life and its deepest workings. We see the underpinnings of human physiology cross-cutting all major scientific areas including medicine, biology, chemistry, and physics. With this state-of-the-art report we provide a broad overview and taxonomy of modern methods used for the visualization of physiological processes. We frame our taxonomy in two layers: the first layer organizes methods according to a spatiotemporal axis that is discretized by scale: molecule, organelle, cell, tissue, and organ scale. A subsequent layer further categorizes these methods according to the visualization approach that accommodates the task they serve: direct visualization, visual analysis and illustrative visualization. This categorization implicitly considers then whether the visualization depicts raw, derived, or abstracted data. Through this taxonomy one may quickly identify the extent (or absence) of visualization efforts to date at each scale for each of the three primary visualization techniques. We conclude our report with an outlook on promising new avenues of research in our efforts to visualize physiological processes.
