_Abstract_:
Human physiology is a complex, multi-faceted science that combines elements of biology, chemistry, physics, and medicine. In this report we offer a broad and multiscale perspective on key developments and highlight key challenges in visualization for physiology. Our literature search process combines standard methods with state-of-the-art visual analysis search tools to identify surveys and representative individual methods or tools papers using visualization for physiology. Our resulting literature taxonomy sorts literature first according to level of biological organization, ranging from molecule to organ. A second layer identifies high-level visualization tasks within each piece of literature: exploration, analysis, and communication. The results of this report may be used for visualization researchers to understand the overarching trends, challenges, and opportunities in visualization for physiology and to provide a foundation for discussion and future research directions in this area.
