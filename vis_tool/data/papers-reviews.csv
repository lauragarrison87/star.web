We give a comprehensive assessment of the analytical tools of network topology and dynamics. The state-of-the-art use of chemical similarity, protein structure, protein–protein interaction, signaling, genetic interaction and metabolic networks in the discovery of drug targets is summarized. We propose that network targeting follows two basic strategies. The “central hit strategy” selectively targets central nodes/edges of the flexible networks of infectious agents or cancer cells to kill them. The “network influence strategy” works against other diseases, where an efficient reconfiguration of rigid networks needs to be achieved by targeting the neighbors of central nodes/edges. It is shown how network techniques can help in the identification of single-target, edgetic, multi-target and allo-network drug target candidates.

Even just at the intermediate scales of individual biomolecules exposed to cellular environments, instead of modeling entire cells, there is actually much that remains to be learned in terms of fundamental biophysics, and this is probably where physical models of cellular environments can have the greatest impact in the near future. However, as the understanding of biomolecular behavior in cells becomes more comprehensive, physical models could be coupled with kinetic network models to add reactivity and to access even longer timescales.

Cellular biology focuses downward from physiology on sequence tracks, whereas the biochemistry gazes upward from nucleotides at macromolecular models. Neither perceives the whole and there remain structures in the data, between chromosome and chromatin, that are unsatisfactorily represented by either browser or 3D viewer. Bridging this visualization gap to provide a homogenized view of these genomic data presents specific challenges: defining a novel visual grammar; augmenting analysis at scale; arranging sensible viewpoints; and capturing the interactive reasoning.

Physical proximity can be represented as two-dimensional heat maps or matrices. From these, three-dimensional (3D) conformations of chromatin can be computed revealing coherent structures that highlight the importance of nonsequential relationships across genomic features. Mainstream genomic browsers have been classically developed to display compact, stacked tracks based on a linear, sequential, per-chromosome coordinate system. Genome-wide comparative analysis demands new approaches to data access and new layouts for analysis. The legibility can be compromised when displaying track-aligned second dimension matrices, which require greater screen space. Moreover, 3D representations of genomes defy vertical alignment in track-based genome browsers. Furthermore, investigation at previously unattainable levels of detail is revealing multiscale, multistate, time-dependent complexity. This article outlines how these challenges are currently handled in mainstream browsers as well as how novel techniques in visualization are being explored to address them. A set of requirements for coherent visualization of novel spatial genomic data is defined and the resulting potential for whole genome visualization is described.","genome, genomics, gene interactions",more important to maximize the use of the 3D data being produced by representing its detail rather than increasing immersion,10.1002/1873-3468.12778,n,done in molecular function

(B) Regions with an active chromatin state (orange) tend to be located towards the centre of the nucleus, while regions with an inactive chromatin state (blue) tend to be located at the nuclear lamina or nucleolus. Regions with a similar chromatin state interact with each other more frequently than expected based on their genomic distance. (C) Self-interacting domains form when a genomic region has preferential interactions with itself compared with neighbouring regions on the chromosome. (D) Loops can form between specific genomic regions. These interactions may be mediated by architectural proteins, transcription factors or chromatin regulators.

Note that visualizations of functional connectivity rely heavily on graph theory---an analytic language suitably concerned with describing the connections between nodes rather than the specific spatial paths connecting them. When the visualized unit becomes the connection between two points rather than the points themselves, novel possibilities emerge for representing connexels in a single image. This insight shifted functional connectivity visualizations from more traditional, anatomically situated representations to figures that focused their content on the graph of node-links or edges. functional connectivity visualization has routinely prioritized anatomical clarity in visualizations over the complexity of connexels 

on functional connectivity dynamics: ""We have thus far addressed the problem of visualizing the three-dimensional space of connections, taking for granted the stability of the functional connectome. An additional dimension is required when the temporal domain is brought into the image along with the spatial (Fig. 8). Early approaches to illustrating brain activity over time used color coded ROIs with representative time-series (Fig. 8a) (Fox et al., 2005) or coherence plots (Fig. 8b) (Chang and Glover, 2010). More recent depictions of the whole brain over time make use of a left-to-right montage, with brains shifting along the series to reveal dynamic changes (Fig. 8d) (Handwerker et al., 2012, Majeed et al., 2011; see Figs. 4 & 6 from Majeed et al., 2009) or correlation matrices (Fig. 8e) (Allen et al., 2012a). However, when anatomical space is not the priority of a visualization, correlations (Fig. 8c) (Hutchison et al., in press) offer another means of conveying the temporal complexity of signal dynamics through broad color motifs. Although there has been limited use of videos as supplementary online material, the medium offers the potential to maintain a stable anatomical position, which allows for the representation of fluctuations along the temporal dimension. AFNI has made a script5 available to create videos6 of data dynamics shown on the cortical surface.""",margulies.jpg,"Margulies, D.S.; Böttger, J.; Watanabe, A.; Gorgolewski, K.J.","Innovations in data visualization punctuate the landmark advances in human connectome research since its beginnings. From tensor glyphs for diffusion-weighted imaging, to advanced rendering of anatomical tracts, to more recent graph-based representations of functional connectivity data, many of the ways we have come to understand the human connectome are through the intuitive insight these visualizations enable. Nonetheless, several unresolved problems persist. For example, probabilistic tractography lacks the visual appeal of its deterministic equivalent, multimodal representations require extreme levels of data reduction, and rendering the full connectome within an anatomical space makes the contents cluttered and unreadable. In part, these challenges require compromises between several tensions that determine connectome visualization practice, such as prioritizing anatomic or connectomic information, aesthetic appeal or information content, and thoroughness or readability. To illustrate the ongoing negotiation between these priorities, we provide an overview of various visualization methods that have evolved for anatomical and functional connectivity data. We then describe interactive visualization tools currently available for use in research, and we conclude with concerns and developments in the presentation of connectivity results.","connectomics, brain, neuroscience","continue research that combines modalities, intuitivie interactions, means of processing ever more complex data, include more work with dynamics of functional connectome (add more of time element)",10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.04.111,n,"done, in brain function"

In this article, methods used for the acquisition, visualization, and quantification of such datasets are reviewed and illustrated. Methods: Currently, the acquisition of 3D cine (4D) phase contrast velocity data, synchronized relative to both cardiac and respiratory movements takes about ten minutes or more, even when using parallel imaging and optimized pulse sequence design. The large resulting datasets need appropriate post processing for the visualization of multidirectional flow, for example as vector fields, pathlines or streamlines, or for retrospective volumetric quantification. Applications: Multidirectional velocity acquisitions have provided 3D visualization of large scale flow features of the healthy heart and great vessels, and have shown altered patterns of flow in abnormal chambers and vessels. Clinically relevant examples include retrograde streams in atheromatous descending aortas as potential thromboembolic pathways in patients with cryptogenic stroke and marked variations of flow visualized in common aortic pathologies. Compared to standard clinical tools, 4D velocity mapping offers the potential for retrospective quantification of flow and other hemodynamic parameters. Conclusions: Multidirectional, 3D cine velocity acquisitions are contributing to the understanding of normal and pathologically altered blood flow features.

All these efforts should serve a single purpose: to improve understanding.
In the recent years, interaction strategies underwent a revolution. Technologies that were previously considered too expensive have become widely available. This allows interaction with biomedical data with new (low cost) interfaces, ameliorating the user experience.
Multiscale visualization and interaction are challenging disciplines of research. These areas are constantly evolving and expanding to other fields.

For 3D data, this is even more challenging as these contain large point-sets that are spatially distributed and may change over time. In certain cases, animation can be useful, although this also provides little insight when there are a large number of changes happening concurrently.

In addition to temporally resolved 3D genome structure data, it is now also possible to measure not only pairwise but also n-way interactions of regions across the whole genome. This will require novel visualization techniques that enable analysts to navigate this highly complex space and select lower-dimensional slices for visualization. A related challenge is the visualization and integration of imaging data (ranging from standard lightfield microscopy to super-resolution microscopy) with genomics data from chromosome conformation capture assays such as Hi-C.

Data visualization also plays an increasing role in how research is communicated.

This article outlines current and future grand challenges in bioinformatics data visualization, and announces the first publication venue dedicated to this subdiscipline.","grand challenges in physiology, physiology visualization, multiscale visualization ","challenges that O'Donoghue identifies: 
1) spatiotemporal organization of chromosomes at molecular resolution (genomics)--understanding this will transform our understanding of what gets transcribed, and how and when transcription is controlled in different cell types. 
2) transcriptomics, rapid advances in single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) techniques now make it possible to track behaviors of individual cells in unprecedented detail, providing a window into events that were previously hidden. For example, scRNA-seq can be used to track cell differentiation and the evolution of cell-cell contacts during the growth of cancerous tumours. Also, in combination with imaging methods, these techniques can be used to resolve the spatial location of RNA transcripts within single cells (use this to understand the mechanisms that control cellular processes)
3) proteomics, advances in high-throughput mass-spectroscopy have begun to provide first glimpses into the highly dynamic epiproteome, i.e., the set of all post-translational modifications (PTMs) made to all proteins in a cell
4) cell biology: determining the spatiotemporal organization of a human cell at molecular resolution, provide structural framework for molecular basis of cell behavior (find location of proteins with imaging and mass-spectrometry techniques, molecular structure with EM, transient complexes from sequence information or MD simulations)
5) tissue-scale imaging, e.g. 2-photon fluroescence microscopy, make 3D maps of mammal brains, track real-time movements of cells and subcellular structures within living tissues, including tumors. Combining these data with tissue-scale or whole-body kinetic modeling (Alqahtani, 2017) has potential to revolutionize our understanding of physiology and the body’s responses to events such as tumor growth or therapeutic interventions. However, extracting insight from such massive, complex datasets requires development of highly tailored, innovative visual analysis methods

Traditionally, a lot of MedViz research has been focused on the visualization of a single, unimodal patient dataset, being usually defined on a regular grid in 3D and capturing a selected part of the human anatomy. As a prominent example, volume rendering has been extensively studied, together with advanced lighting simulation, etc. In recent years, however, the most pressing challenges in MedViz have broadened, not at the least paralleling new developments in image acquisition, and being associated with a growing data complexity, and advances in medical diagnosis and patient treatment. It is now becoming increasingly common, that several datasets are acquired, also at different points in time, and that in-vivo information, related to physiology, is complementing the more traditional anatomical information. Different imaging modalities are applied and whole-body scans facilitate the screening for disease and amplify the opportunities of forensic pathology. Data may also be measured or computed in a numerical simulation over complex grids, e.g., in ultrasound imaging or in the simulation of blood flow in cerebral and aortic aneurysms. All this data needs to be integrated with the anatomical scans. While traditional MedViz usually focuses on data of a single patient, the large data pools that are acquired in longitudinal cohort studies, for example, in epidemiology, involving hundreds to thousands of individuals (the cohort) pose tremendous new challenges. These include the combined visualization of image and non-image data as well as the integrated visualization of heterogeneous data. The effective and efficient interactive exploration of large medical data requires innovative technology and dedicated interaction techniques such as table-top user interfaces and gesture-based interaction. In this tutorial, we discuss the above-mentioned modern challenges in MedViz, followed by examples of and strategies for the development of new solutions to cope with these challenges with respect to specific (clinical) problems.

Although phenotypic data derived from images are difficult to explore and analyse, some researchers have successfully addressed this with visualization. Nonetheless, visualization methods for live cell imaging data have been reported in an ad hoc and fragmented fashion. This leads to a knowledge gap where it is difficult for biologists and visualization developers to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of different visualization methods, and for visualization researchers to gain an overview of existing work to identify research priorities. To address this gap, we survey existing visualization methods for live cell imaging from a visualization research perspective for the first time. Based on recent visualization theory, we perform a structured qualitative analysis of visualization methods that includes characterizing the domain and data, abstracting tasks, and describing visual encoding and interaction design. Based on our survey, we identify and discuss research gaps that future work should address: the broad analytical context of live cell imaging; the importance of behavioural comparisons; links with dynamic data visualization; the consequences of different data modalities; shortcomings in interactive support; and, in addition to analysis, the value of the presentation of phenotypic data and insights to other stakeholders.","live cell imaging, task analysis, cell behavior","broad analytical contect of live cell image data, may to use ontologies to drive organization of visualization methods.

The surface of a protein forms the interface to the environment, so accurate and fast representations of these complicated shapes are required.

More recently, time-resolved PC-MRI with velocity encoding along all three flow directions and three-dimensional (3D) anatomic coverage (also termed ‘4D flow MRI’) has been developed and applied for the evaluation of cardiovascular hemodynamics in multiple regions of the human body. 4D flow MRI allows for the comprehensive evaluation of complex blood flow patterns by 3D blood flow visualization and flexible retrospective quantification of flow parameters. Recent technical developments, including the utilization of advanced parallel imaging techniques such as k-t GRAPPA, have resulted in reasonable overall scan times, e.g., 8-12 minutes for 4D flow MRI of the aorta and 10-20 minutes for whole heart coverage.
