By aligning the main reference direction of the flow, i.e., the center line of the bounding tubular structure, with one axis of the screen, we are able to natively juxtapose (1.) different visualizations of the same flow, either utilizing different flow visualization techniques, or by varying parameters of a chosen approach such as the choice of seeding locations for integration-based flow visualization, (2.) the different time steps of a time-dependent flow, (3.) different projections around the center line , and (4.) quantitative flow visualizations in immediate spatial relation to the more qualitative classical flow visualization.

In this paper a three dimensional (3D) model of the Human Ventricular System (HVS) is used to investigate the flow of CSF within the human brain, using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). CSF can be modelled as a Newtonian Fluid and its flow through the HVS can be visualized using CFD. In this investigation a 3D geometric model of the HVS is constructed from MRI data. It is the only model of its type to date. The flow of CSF within the HVS is a complicated phenomenon due to the complex HVS geometry. Understanding the nature of CSF flow allows engineers and physicians to design medical techniques and drugs to treat various HVS complications, such as hydrocephalus as a result of a tumour.","flow visualization, particles, streamlines",---

Materials and Methods: 4D PC-MRI was performed in 11 patients with AscAD (46.3 6 22.0 years) and 10 healthy volunteers (32.9 6 13.4 years) after written informed consent and institutional review board approval. Following manual vessel wall segmentation of the ascending aorta (MATLAB, The Mathworks, Natick, MA), a 3D surface was created using spline interpolation. Spatial WSS variation based on surface division in 12 segments and temporal variation were evaluated in AscAD and normal aortas. Visual analysis of flow patterns was performed based on streamlines and particle traces using EnSight (v9.0, CEI, Apex, NC). Results: AscAD was associated with significantly increased diastolic WSS, decreased systolic to diastolic WSS ratio, and delayed onset of peak WSS (all P < 0.001). Temporally averaged WSS was increased and peak systolic WSS was decreased. The maximum WSS in AscAD was on the anterior wall of the ascending aorta. Vortical flow with highest velocities along the anterior wall and increased helical flow during diastole were observed in AscAD compared with controls. Conclusion: Changes in WSS in the ascending aorta of AscAD correspond to observed alterations in flow patterns compared to controls.","streamlines, slice rendering",---

Flow-sensitive four-dimensional MRI data acquired with contrast agent provided significantly improved signal-to-noise ratio in magnitude data and noise reduction in velocity data compared to measurements without contrast media.

Using phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (PC-MRI) blood flow can be measured. For the inspection of such flow, researchers often rely on methods that require additional scans produced by different imaging modalities to provide context. This requires labor-intensive registration and often manual segmentation before any exploration of the data is performed. This work provides a framework that allows for a quick exploration of cardiac flow without the need of additional imaging and time-consuming segmentation. To achieve this, only the 4D data from one PC-MRI scan is used. A context visualization is derived automatically from the data, and provides context for the flow. Instead of relying on segmentation to deliver an accurate context, the heart’s ventricles are approximated by half-ellipsoids that can be placed with minimal user interaction. Furthermore, seeding positions for flow visualization can be placed automatically in areas of interest defined by the user and based on derived flow features.

The analysis of long simulations of molecular dynamics produces a large number of voids which have to be further explored and evaluated. In this paper we propose three new methods: two of them convey important properties along the long axis of a selected void during molecular dynamics and one provides a comprehensive picture across the void. The first two proposed methods use a specific heat map to present two types of information: an overview of all detected tunnels in the dynamics and their bottleneck width and stability over time, and an overview of a specific tunnel in the dynamics showing the bottleneck position and changes of the tunnel length over time. These methods help to select a small subset of tunnels, which are explored individually and in detail. For this stage we propose the third method, which shows in one static image the temporal evolvement of the shape of the most critical tunnel part, i.e., its bottleneck. This view is enriched with abstract depictions of different physicochemical properties of the amino acids surrounding the bottleneck.

Because these two steps are inherently linked, we adopt the so-called region-based joint detection-estimation (JDE) framework that addresses this joint issue using a multivariate inference for detection and estimation. JDE is built by making use of a regional bilinear generative model of the BOLD response and constraining the parameter estimation by physiological priors using temporal and spatial information in a Markovian model. In contrast to previous works that use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques to sample the resulting intractable posterior distribution, we recast the JDE into a missing data framework and derive a variational expectation-maximization (VEM) algorithm for its inference. A variational approximation is used to approximate the Markovian model in the unsupervised spatially adaptive JDE inference, which allows automatic fine-tuning of spatial regularization parameters.

Results: The MoFlow system produces high-quality renderings of molecular motion as atom pathlines, as well as interactive WebGL visualizations, and 3D printable models. In a preliminary user study, MoFlow representations are shown to be superior to canonical representations for conveying molecular motion. Conclusions: Pathline-based representations of molecular motion are more easily understood than timeline representations. Pathline representations provide other advantages because they represent motion directly, rather than representing structure with inferred motion.","molecular shape, pathlines, color coded",comparative visualization for multiple molecules

Such data have shown potential to improve diagnosis and risk assessment of various cardiovascular diseases. Hereby, a unique way of analysing patient-specific haemodynamics becomes possible. However, these measurements are susceptible to artifacts, noise and a coarse spatio-temporal resolution. Furthermore, typical flow visualization techniques rely on interpolation. For example, using pathlines requires a high quality temporal resolution. While numerical simulations, based on mathematical flow models, address some of these limitations, the involved modelling assumptions (e.g., regarding the inflow and mesh) do not provide patientspecific data to the degree actual measurements would. To overcome this issue, data assimilation techniques can be applied to use measured data in order to steer a physically-based simulation of the flow, combining the benefits of measured data and simulation. Our work builds upon such an existing solution to increase the temporal resolution of the measured data, but achieves significantly higher fidelity. We avoid the previous damping and interpolation bias towards one of the measurements, by simulating bidrectionally (forwards and backwards through time) and using sources and sinks. Our method is evaluated and compared to the, currently-used, conventional interpolation scheme and forward-only simulation using measured and analytical flow data. It reduces artifacts, noise, and interpolation error, while being closer to laminar flow, as is expected for flow in vessels.","flow visualization, arrows, isosurface",---

To gain insights into the activities of stromal cell populations, we developed and applied multicolor imaging techniques to analyze the behavior of these cells within different tumor microenvironments in the same live mouse. We found that regulatory T-lymphocytes (Tregs) migrated in proximity to blood vessels. Dendriticlike cells, myeloid cells and carcinoma-associated fibroblasts all exhibited higher motility in the microenvironment at the tumor periphery than within the tumor mass. Since oxygen levels differ between tumor microenvironments, we tested if acute hypoxia could account for the differences in cell migration. Direct visualization revealed that Tregs ceased migration under acute systemic hypoxia, whereas myeloid cells continued migrating. In the same mouse and microenvironment, we experimentally subdivided the myeloid cell population and revealed that uptake of fluorescent dextran defined a low-motility subpopulation expressing markers of tumor-promoting, alternatively activated macrophages. In contrast, fluorescent anti-Gr1 antibodies marked myeloid cells patrolling inside tumor vessels and in the stroma.

Current modeling approaches are usually confined to intra-patient registration of 3D image data representing the individual patient’s anatomy at different breathing phases. We propose an approach to generate a mean motion model of the lung based on thoracic 4D computed tomography (CT) data of different patients to extend the motion modeling capabilities. Our modeling process consists of three steps: an intra-subject registration to generate subject-specific motion models, the generation of an average shape and intensity atlas of the lung as anatomical reference frame, and the registration of the subject-specific motion models to the atlas in order to build a statistical 4D mean motion model (4D-MMM). Furthermore, we present methods to adapt the 4D mean motion model to a patient-specific lung geometry. In all steps, a symmetric diffeomorphic nonlinear intensity-based registration method was employed. The Log-Euclidean framework was used to compute statistics on the diffeomorphic transformations. The presented methods are then used to build a mean motion model of respiratory lung motion using thoracic 4D CT data sets of 17 patients. We evaluate the model by applying it for estimating respiratory motion of ten lung cancer patients. The prediction is evaluated with respect to landmark and tumor motion, and the quantitative analysis results in a mean target registration error (TRE) of ? ? _x0002_ _x0003_ mm if lung dynamics are not impaired by large lung tumors or other lung disorders (e.g., emphysema). With regard to lung tumor motion, we show that prediction accuracy is independent of tumor size and tumor motion amplitude in the considered data set. However, tumors adhering to non-lung structures degrade local lung dynamics significantly and the model-based prediction accuracy is lower in these cases. The statistical respiratory motion model is capable of providing valuable prior knowledge in many fields of applications. We present two examples of possible applications in radiation therapy and image guided diagnosis.","color coded, slice rendering, statistics",include the variability of the motion into the model

However, before this new data can be used in clinical studies or for diagnosis, it is important to develop a notion of the characteristics of typical flow structures. To support this process we developed a novel blood flow clustering and exploration method. The method builds on the concept of coherent flow structures. Coherence maps for crosssectional slices are defined to show the overall degree of coherence of the flow. In coherent regions the method summarizes the dominant blood flow using a small number of pathline representatives. In contrast to other clustering approaches the clustering is restricted to coherent regions and pathlines with low coherence values, which are not suitable for clustering and thus are not forced into clusters. The coherence map is based on the Finite-time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE). It is created on selected planes in the inflow respective outflow area of a region of interest. The FTLE value measures the rate of separation of pathlines originating from this plane. Different to previous work using FTLE we do not focus on separating extremal lines but on local minima and regions of low FTLE intensities to extract coherent flow. The coherence map and the extracted clusters serve as basis for the flow exploration. The extracted clusters can be selected and inspected individually. Their flow rate and coherence provide a measure for their significance. Switching off clusters reduces the amount of occlusion and reveals the remaining part of the flow. The non-coherent regions can also be explored by interactive manual pathline seeding in the coherence map.","pathlines, flow visualization, clustering, coherence maps",---

The transportation of ligand into the protein active site is often complex process, driven by geometric and physico-chemical properties, which renders the ligand path full of jitter and impasses. This prevents understanding of the ligand transportation and reasoning behind its behavior along the path. Results: To address the needs of the domain experts we design an explorative visualization solution based on a multi-scale simplification model. It helps to navigate the user to the most interesting parts of the ligand trajectory by exploring different attributes of the ligand and its movement, such as its distance to the active site, changes of amino acids lining the ligand, or ligand ""stuckness"". The process is supported by three linked views - 3D representation of the simplified trajectory, scatterplot matrix, and bar charts with line representation of ligand-lining amino acids. Conclusions: The usage of our tool is demonstrated on molecular dynamics simulations provided by the domain experts. The tool was tested by the domain experts from protein engineering and the results confirm that it helps to navigate the user to the most interesting parts of the ligand trajectory and to understand the ligand behavior.","flow visualization, simplified trajectory, color coded, scatterplot, boxplot, brushing",---

An effective visual exploration of several hemodynamic attributes like the wall shear stress (WSS) and the inflow jet is necessary to understand the hemodynamics. Moreover, the correlation between focus-and-context attributes is of particular interest. An expressive visualization of these attributes and anatomic information requires appropriate visualization techniques to minimize visual clutter and occlusions. We present the FLOWLENS as a focus-and-context approach that addresses these requirements. We group relevant hemodynamic attributes to pairs of focus-and-context attributes and assign them to different anatomic scopes. For each scope, we propose several FLOWLENS visualization templates to provide a flexible visual filtering of the involved hemodynamic pairs. A template consists of the visualization of the focus attribute and the additional depiction of the context attribute inside the lens. Furthermore, the FLOWLENS supports local probing and the exploration of attribute changes over time. The FLOWLENS minimizes visual cluttering, occlusions, and provides a flexible exploration of a region of interest. We have applied our approach to seven representative datasets, including steady and unsteady flow data from CFD simulations and 4D PC-MRI measurements. Informal user interviews with three domain experts confirm the usefulness of our approach.","flow visualization, pathlines, focus and context",Investigate how effective and expressive seeding strategies can be incorporated during the visual exploration

The aims of this study was to evaluate its applicability in scanning and volume estimation of the gastric antrum in humans. Merhodr: Twenty patients with functional dyspepsia and 20 healthy controls, comparable with regard to gender, age, and smoking habits, agreed to be scanned while ingesting 500 ml of meat soup. A mechanical scanner with a 3.25-MHz transducer coupled to a tilting motor provided in 3sec multiple images of the antrum during fasting and 1, 10, and 30min postprandially. On a Unix work station planar contours of the antrum were selected and drawn manually before organ reconstruction and volume computation. Results: Two volume scans of 160 could not be analyzed due to air in the antrum. Up to 5 cm proximal to the pylorus, volumes could be computed in 95% of fasting samples and in 98% of postprandial samples, versus 8% and 75%, respectively, up to 7 cm proximal to the pylorus. We found no significant differences in antral volumes between dyspeptic patients and controls, either fasting or postprandially. Fasting antral volumes in Helicobacter pylori-positive dyspeptics were smaller than in H. pylori-negative patients (P = 0.02). Conclusions: Three-dimensional ultrasonography by use of a tilting motor makes non-invasive volume estimation of the gastric antrum possible without making assumptions about its geometry. In the present material no difference was found in antral volumes between patients with functional dyspepsia and controls. It is possible that fasting antral volumes in dyspeptic patients are dependent on H. pylori status","small multiples, volume, mesh",---

To increase the moderate specificity of DCE-MRI, and therefore, the distinction of benign and malign ant tumors, the tumor's heterogeneity and the tumor's enhancement kinetics have to be evaluated. In clinical practice, the tumor's enhancement  kinetics are analyzed via time-intensity curves after manual placement of regions of interest (ROI). A substantial limitation of the ROI analysis is the inter-observervariability as well as the potential distortion of the ROI's average curve, e.g. if the ROI covers benign and malign ant tumor tissue. We present a visual analytics approach for breast tumors in DCE-MRI data that comprises a voxel wise glyph based overview and a region based analysis. The regions are extracted via region merging and each region contains voxels with similar perfusion characteristics. As a result, we avoid the inter observervariability and reduce distortion due to averaging over differently perfused tissue. A comparative study of 20 datasets was carried out to test our approach and an adapted time intensity curve classification method. Moreover, the influence of similarity measurements and a potential region based exploration are discussed. In conclusion, the presented features as similarity criteria yield the best results regarding the finer classification of the early contrast agent accumulation and the region's enhancement kinetics in the intermediate and late post contrast phase since spatial information is included and the merging of regions with different perfusion characteristics is impeded.","brushing, voxel-wise glyph, regions specification, connecting spatial and nonspatial information, brushing","the local information, that is employed for the merge step during the segmentation process, could be analyzed for an improved local registration."

While covalent interactions impose the structural integrity of molecules, noncovalent interactions govern more subtle phenomena such as protein folding, bonding or self assembly. The understanding of these types of interactions is necessary for the interpretation of many biological processes and chemical design tasks. While traditionally the electron density is analyzed to interpret the quantum chemistry of a molecular system, noncovalent interactions are characterized by low electron densities and only slight variations of them - challenging their extraction and characterization. Recently, the signed electron density and the reduced gradient, two scalar fields derived from the electron density, have drawn much attention in quantum chemistry since they enable a qualitative visualization of these interactions even in complex molecular systems and experimental measurements. In this work, we present the first combinatorial algorithm for the automated extraction and characterization of covalent and noncovalent interactions in molecular systems. The proposed algorithm is based on a joint topological analysis of the signed electron density and the reduced gradient. Combining the connectivity information of the critical points of these two scalar fields enables to visualize, enumerate, classify and investigate molecular interactions in a robust manner. Experiments on a variety of molecular systems, from simple dimers to proteins or DNA, demonstrate the ability of our technique to robustly extract these interactions and to reveal their structural relations to the atoms and bonds forming the molecules. For simple systems, our analysis corroborates the observations made by the chemists while it provides new visual and quantitative insights on chemical interactions for larger molecular systems.","arrow glyphs, topological analysis",---

Blood flow velocities measured by MRI were 31-39% lower than in DS. However, PI and RI differed by only 13-16%. Rating of 3D flow characteristics in the ICA revealed consistent patterns for filling and helical flow in volunteers. In patients with ICA stenosis, 3D blood flow visualization was successfully employed to detect markedly altered filling and helical flow patterns (forward-moving spiral flow) in the ICA bulb and to evaluate the effect of revascularization, which restored filling and helical flow.

Research in this field is hampered by a lack of techniques that allow quantification of tissue architecture and its development. To bridge this gap, we have established a procedure based on confocal laser scans, image processing, and three-dimensional tissue reconstruction, as well as quantitative mathematical modeling. As a proof of principle, we reconstructed and modeled liver regeneration in mice after damage by CCl4, a prototypical inducer of pericentral liver damage.We have chosen the regenerating liver as an example because of the tight link between liver architecture and function: the complex microarchitecture formed by hepatocytes and microvessels, i.e. sinusoids, ensures optimal exchange of metabolites between blood and hepatocytes. Our model captures all hepatocytes and sinusoids of a liver lobule during a 16 days regeneration process. The model unambiguously predicted a so-far unrecognized mechanism as essential for liver regeneration, whereby daughter hepatocytes align along the orientation of the closest sinusoid, a process which we named “hepatocyte-sinusoid alignment” (HSA). The simulated tissue architecture was only in agreement with the experimentally obtained data when HSA was included into the model and, moreover, no other likely mechanism could replace it. In order to experimentally validate the model of prediction of HSA, we analyzed the three-dimensional orientation of daughter hepatocytes in relation to the sinusoids.

These data describe complex 3D motions (e.g. chewing, walking, flying) performed by animals and humans and captured via high-speed imaging technologies, such as biplane fluoroscopy. In analyzing these 3D biomechanical motions, interactive 3D visualizations are important, in particular, for supporting spatial analysis. However, as researchers in information visualization have pointed out, 2D visualizations can also be effective tools for multi-dimensional data analysis, especially for identifying trends over time. Our approach, therefore, combines techniques from both 3D and 2D visualizations. Specifically, it utilizes a multi-view visualization strategy including a small multiples view of motion sequences, a parallel coordinates view, and detailed 3D inspection views. The resulting framework follows an overview first, zoom and filter, then details-on-demand style of analysis, and it explicitly targets a limitation of current tools, namely, supporting analysis and comparison at the level of a collection of motions rather than sequential analysis of a single or small number of motions. Scientific motion collections appropriate for this style of analysis exist in clinical work in orthopedics and physical rehabilitation, in the study of functional morphology within evolutionary biology, and in other contexts. An application is described based on a collaboration with evolutionary biologists studying the mechanics of chewing motions in pigs.

Improved flow measuring modalities and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations yield in reliable blood flow information. For a visual exploration of the flow information, domain experts are used to investigate the flow information combined with its enclosed vessel anatomy. Since the flow is spatially embedded in the surrounding vessel surface, occlusion problems have to be resolved. A visual reduction of the vessel surface that still provides important anatomical features is required. We accomplish this by applying an adaptive surface visualization inspired by the suggestive contour measure. Furthermore, an illustration is employed to highlight the animated pathlines and to emphasize nearby surface regions. Our approach combines several visualization techniques to improve the perception of surface shape and depth. Thereby, we ensure appropriate visibility of the embedded flow information, which can be depicted with established or advanced flow visualization techniques.

For a deeper understanding of the complex interdependencies between genes, it is important to bring gene expressions (measurements) into context with pathways. Pathways, which are models of biological processes, are available in online databases. In these databases, large networks are decomposed into small sub-graphs for better manageability. This simplification results in a loss of context, as pathways are interconnected and genes can occur in multiple instances scattered over the network. Our main goal is therefore to present all relevant information, i.e., gene expressions, the relations between expression and pathways and between multiple pathways in a simple, yet effective way. To achieve this we employ two different multiple-view approaches. Traditional multiple views are used for large datasets or highly interactive visualizations, while a 2.5D technique is employed to support a seamless navigation of multiple pathways which simultaneously links to the expression of the contained genes. This approach facilitates the understanding of the interconnection of pathways, and enables a non-distracting relation to gene expression data. We evaluated Caleydo with a group of users from the life science community. Users were asked to perform three tasks: pathway exploration, gene expression analysis and information comparison with and without visual links, which had to be conducted in four different conditions. Evaluation results show that the system can improve the process of understanding the complex network of pathways and the individual effects of gene expression regulation considerably. Especially the quality of the available contextual information and the spatial organization was rated good for the presented 2.5D setup.","visual link, closeup",Comparative analysis of multiple paths

They reduce the complexity of the overall biological network by partitioning it into smaller manageable parts. While this reduction of complexity is their biggest strength, it is, at the same time, their biggest weakness. By removing what is deemed not important for the primary function of the pathway, biologists lose the ability to follow and understand cross-talks between pathways. Considering these cross-talks is, however, critical in many analysis scenarios, such as judging effects of drugs. In this paper we introduce Entourage, a novel visualization technique that provides contextual information lost due to the artificial partitioning of the biological network, but at the same time limits the presented information to what is relevant to the analyst's task. We use one pathway map as the focus of an analysis and allow a larger set of contextual pathways. For these context pathways we only show the contextual subsets, i.e., the parts of the graph that are relevant to a selection. Entourage suggests related pathways based on similarities and highlights parts of a pathway that are interesting in terms of mapped experimental data. We visualize interdependencies between pathways using stubs of visual links, which we found effective yet not obtrusive. By combining this approach with visualization of experimental data, we can provide domain experts with a highly valuable tool. We demonstrate the utility of Entourage with case studies conducted with a biochemist who researches the effects of drugs on pathways. We show that the technique is well suited to investigate interdependencies between pathways and to analyze, understand, and predict the effect that drugs have on different cell types.","bucket view, visual link, parallel coordinates, heatmap, dendrogram",Integrate biomedical data from different domains

In this article, methods used for the acquisition, visualization, and quantification of such datasets are reviewed and illustrated. Methods: Currently, the acquisition of 3D cine (4D) phase contrast velocity data, synchronized relative to both cardiac and respiratory movements takes about ten minutes or more, even when using parallel imaging and optimized pulse sequence design. The large resulting datasets need appropriate post processing for the visualization of multidirectional flow, for example as vector fields, pathlines or streamlines, or for retrospective volumetric quantification. Applications: Multidirectional velocity acquisitions have provided 3D visualization of large scale flow features of the healthy heart and great vessels, and have shown altered patterns of flow in abnormal chambers and vessels. Clinically relevant examples include retrograde streams in atheromatous descending aortas as potential thromboembolic pathways in patients with cryptogenic stroke and marked variations of flow visualized in common aortic pathologies. Compared to standard clinical tools, 4D velocity mapping offers the potential for retrospective quantification of flow and other hemodynamic parameters. Conclusions: Multidirectional, 3D cine velocity acquisitions are contributing to the understanding of normal and pathologically altered blood flow features. Although more rapid and user-friendly strategies for acquisition and analysis may be needed before 4D velocity acquisitions come to be adopted in routine clinical CMR, their capacity to measure multidirectional flows throughout a study volume has contributed novel insights into cardiovascular fluid dynamics in health and disease.",---,---

Several approaches are widely used to facilitate this process. While all these approaches are inherently different, they are still subject to uncertainty arising from various stages of the modeling process. In this paper we propose a novel approach for deriving and visualizing uncertainty in kinetic PET modeling. We distinguish between intra- and inter-model uncertainties. While intra-model uncertainty allows us to derive uncertainty based on a single modeling approach, inter-model uncertainty arises from the differences of the results of different approaches. To derive intra-model uncertainty we exploit the covariance matrix analysis. The inter-model uncertainty is derived by comparing the outcome of three standard kinetic PET modeling approaches. We derive and visualize this uncertainty to exploit it as a basis for changing model input parameters with the ultimate goal to reduce the modeling uncertainty and thus obtain a more realistic model of the tracer under investigation. To support this uncertainty reduction process, we visually link abstract and spatial data by introducing a novel visualization approach based on the ThemeRiver metaphor, which has been modified to support the uncertainty-aware visualization of parameter changes between spatial locations.

The building blocks of the model are individual deformable ellipsoidal cells, where movement depends on internal parameter state (cell size and stiffness) and on external cues from the neighboring cells, extracellular matrix, and chemical signals. Cell movement and deformation are calculated from equations of motion using the total force acting on each cell, ensuring that forces are balanced. The simulations show that the sorting patterns of prestalk and prespore cells, emerging during the slug stage, depend critically on the type of cell adhesion and not just on chemotactic differences between cells. This occurs because cell size and stiffness can prevent the otherwise faster cells from passing the slower cells. The patterns are distinctively different when the prestalk cells are more or less adhesive than the prespore cells. These simulations suggest that sorting is not solely due to differential chemotaxis, and that differences in both adhesion strength and type between different cell types play a very significant role, both in Dictyostelium and other systems.","slice rendering, density rendering, 3D view, animation",---

We address these by combining visual summaries of the spatiotemporal behaviour of an arbitrary number of lineages, including variation from average behaviour, with node-link representations that emphasise the presence or absence of symmetry and synchrony.

It lets us understand a normal heart’s morphology and also explains the formation of congenital heart defects. However, learning cardiac embryology is difficult because the processes underlying the heart formation are complex. This complexity is caused by the fact that complicated organs like the heart are generated from only a couple of cells. Heart development isn’t easy to learn because students must understand the spatial arrangement of the anatomical structures and be able to perceive the dynamic evolution of these structures in its whole complexity. Students have traditionally studied heart development through either lectures or textbooks. But none of these teaching modalities adequately describes the spatiotemporal complexity of the heart’s development. To get an idea of the difficulty of such a description, see the sidebar “Development of Cardiac Outflow Tracts.” Classically, the descriptions are illustrated by sketches like Figure 1 that help us visualize or represent the spatiotemporal evolution of this phenomenon.1 However, such drawings and sketches aren’t effective because 2D pictures only give a partial impression of the objects’ geometry. Moreover, the dynamics of structural evolution can only be rendered with a limited sequence of static images. This inadequacy in representing complex spatial developments is a major limitation. As a result, researchers must undergo the tricky task of graphically illustrating the generation and temporal transformation of most cardiac structures. Fortunately, advanced computer graphics can provide substantial improvements for teaching medicine (see, for example, the special CG&Aissue on imaging in medical education2) by letting researchers design, model, visualize, and manipulate 3D objects as well as produce animated movies.

Nearly half of all heart failures occur due to the decline in the performance of the left ventricle (LV). Therefore, early detection, monitoring, and accurate diagnosis of LV pathologies are of critical importance. Usually, global cardiac function parameters are used to assess the cardiac structure and function, although regional abnormalities are important biomarkers of several cardiac diseases. Regional motion of the myocardium, the muscular wall of the LV, can be captured in a non-invasive manner using the velocity-encoded magnetic resonance (MR) imaging method known as Tissue Phase Mapping (TPM). To analyze the complex motion pattern, one typically visualizes for each time step the radial, longitudinal, and circumferential velocities separately according to the American Heart Association (AHA) model, which makes the comprehension of the spatio-temporal pattern an extremely challenging cognitive task. We propose novel spatio-temporal visualization methods for LV myocardial motion analysis with less cognitive load. Our approach uses coordinated views for navigating through the data space. One view visualizes individual time steps, which can be scrolled or animated, while a second view visualizes the temporal evolution using the radial layout of a polar plot for the time dimension. Different designs for visual encoding were considered in both views and evaluated with medical experts to demonstrate and compare their effectiveness and intuitiveness for detecting and analyzing regional abnormalities.","bullseye, warping, pins, lines",---

Myocardial motion is estimated within a 4-dimensional (4D) registration framework, in which all 3D images obtained at different cardiac phases are simultaneously registered. This facilitates spatio-temporally consistent estimation of motion as opposed to other registrationbased algorithms which estimate the motion by sequentially registering one frame to another. To facilitate image matching, an attribute vector (AV) is constructed for each point in the image, and is intended to serve as a “morphological signature” of that point. The AV includes intensity, boundary, and geometric moment invariants (GMIs). Hierarchical registration of two image sequences is achieved by using the most distinctive points for initial registration of two sequences and gradually adding less-distinctive points to refine the registration. Experimental results on real data demonstrate good performance of the proposed method for cardiac image registration and motion estimation. The motion estimation is validated via comparisons with motion estimates obtained from MR images with myocardial tagging.","3D view, slice rendering, color coded",---

However, medical imaging modalities such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging can be used to observe lung morphology. It would be helpful to be able to correlate regional morphological changes with changes in pulmonary function. We present an approach toward the quantification of pulmonary deformation via non-rigid registration of serial MR images of the lung using the variational framework implemented in the Insight toolkit. Conventional registration methods, as exemplified by a finite element implementation of the classic elastic matching technique, are shown to perform well over a set of vascular landmarks in the measurement of lung motion. This performance is maintained in an augmented system, which combines inhomogeneous material properties with the use of domain discretizations tailored to reflect the apparent geometry within the image and to reduce background effects. These adaptations lay the groundwork for biomechanical modeling of the lung using the finite element method.","flow visualization, slice rendering, color coded, arrows",---

Regions that show such correlated behavior are said to form resting-state networks (RSNs). RSNs have been investigated using seed-dependent functional connectivity maps and by using a number of model-free methods. However, examining RSNs across a group of subjects is still a complex task and often involves human input in selecting meaningful networks. Methodology/Principal Findings: We report on a voxel based model-free normalized cut graph clustering approach with whole brain coverage for group analysis of resting-state data, in which the number of RSNs is computed as an optimal clustering fit of the data. Inter-voxel correlations of time-series are grouped at the individual level and the consistency of the resulting networks across subjects is clustered at the group level, defining the group RSNs. We scanned a group of 26 subjects at rest with a fast BOLD sensitive fMRI scanning protocol on a 3 Tesla MR scanner. Conclusions/Significance: An optimal group clustering fit revealed 7 RSNs. The 7 RSNs included motor/visual, auditory and attention networks and the frequently reported default mode network.

Understanding the mechanisms controlling neural stem cell proliferation and differentiation will play a key role in the emerging fields of regenerative medicine and cancer therapeutics. Stem cell studies in vitro from 2-D image data are well established. Visualizing and analyzing large three dimensional images of intact tissue is a challenging task. It becomes more difficult as the dimensionality of the image data increases to include time and additional fluorescence channels. There is a pressing need for 5-D image analysis and visualization tools to study cellular dynamics in the intact niche and to quantify the role that environmental factors play in determining cell fate. Results: We present an application that integrates visualization and quantitative analysis of 5-D (x,y,z,t,c h a n n e l) and large montage confocal fluorescence microscopy images. The image sequences show stem cells together with blood vessels, enabling quantification of the dynamic behaviors of stem cells in relation to their vascular niche, with applications in developmental and cancer biology. Our application automatically segments, tracks, and lineages the image sequence data and then allows the user to view and edit the results of automated algorithms in a stereoscopic 3-D window while simultaneously viewing the stem cell lineage tree in a 2-D window. Using the GPU to store and render the image sequence data enables a hybrid computational approach. An inference-based approach utilizing user-provided edits to automatically correct related mistakes executes interactively on the system CPU while the GPU handles 3-D visualization tasks. Conclusions: By exploiting commodity computer gaming hardware, we have developed an application that can be run in the laboratory to facilitate rapid iteration through biological experiments.

The tongue is modeled with the Finite Element Method (FEM) and driven by the motion capture data gathered during speech production. Several novel deformation visualization techniques are presented for in-depth data analysis and exploration. To reveal the hidden semantic information of the tongue deformation, we present a novel physics-based volume segmentation algorithm. This is accomplished by decomposing the tongue model into segments based on its deformation pattern with the computation of deformation subspaces and fitting the target deformation locally at each segment. In addition, the strain energy is utilized to provide an intuitive low-dimensional visualization for the high-dimensional sequential motion. Energy-interpolation-based morphing is also equipped to effectively highlight the subtle differences of the 3D deformed shapes without any visual occlusion. Our experimental results and analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework. The proposed methods, though originally designed for the exploration of the tongue deformation, are also valid for general deformation analysis of other shapes.","mesh, small multiples, color coded",Speech production

However, in all modeling studies reported so far numerous simplifications were made in terms of representing biophysical details of cellular function and its heterogeneity, gross anatomy and tissue microstructure, as well as the bidirectional coupling between electrophysiology (EP) and tissue distension. One limiting factor is the employed spatial discretization methods which are not sufficiently flexible to accommodate complex geometries or resolve heterogeneities, but, even more importantly, the limited efficiency of the prevailing solver techniques which are not sufficiently scalable to deal with the incurring increase in degrees of freedom (DOF) when modeling cardiac electromechanics at high spatio-temporal resolution. This study reports on the development of a novel methodology for solving the nonlinear equation of finite elasticity using human whole organ models of cardiac electromechanics, discretized at a high para-cellular resolution. Three patient-specific, anatomically accurate, whole heart EM models were reconstructed from magnetic resonance (MR) scans at resolutions of 220 μm, 440 μm and 880 μm, yielding meshes of approximately 184.6, 24.4 and 3.7 million tetrahedral elements and 95.9, 13.2 and 2.1 million displacement DOF, respectively. The same mesh was used for discretizing the governing equations of both electrophysiology (EP) and nonlinear elasticity. A novel algebraic multigrid (AMG) preconditioner for an iterative Krylov solver was developed to deal with the resulting computational load. The AMG preconditioner was designed under the primary objective of achieving favorable strong scaling characteristics for both setup and solution runtimes, as this is key for exploiting current high performance computing hardware. Benchmark results using the 220 μm, 440 μm and 880 μm meshes demonstrate efficient scaling up to 1024, 4096 and 8192 compute cores which allowed the simulation of a single heart beat in 44.3, 87.8 and 235.3 minutes, respectively. The efficiency of the method allows fast simulation cycles without compromising anatomical or biophysical detail.","Cardiac Electromechanics, Algebraic Multigrid, Parallel Computing, Whole Heart Model",---

Therefore, it is of main interest, to estimate the risk of rupture, to gain a deeper understanding of aneurysm genesis, and to plan an actual intervention, the surface morphology and the internal blood flow characteristics. Visual exploration is primarily used to understand such complex and variable type of data. Since the blood flow data is strongly influenced by the surrounding vessel morphology both have to be visually combined to efficiently support visual exploration. Since the flow is spatially embedded in the surrounding aneurysm surface, occlusion problems have to be tackled. Thereby, a meaningful visual reduction of the aneurysm surface that still provides morphological hints is necessary. We accomplish this by applying an adapted illustrative rendering style to the aneurysm surface. Our contribution lies in the combination and adaption of several rendering styles, which allow us to reduce the problem of occlusion and avoid most of the disadvantages of the traditional semi-transparent surface rendering, like ambiguities in perception of spatial relationships. In interviews with domain experts, we derived visual requirements. Later, we conducted an initial survey with 40 participants (13 medical experts of them), which leads to further improvements of our approach.","illustrative visualization, ambient occlusion",semi-automatic extraction of morphologic features

Many approaches of fiber clustering reported in the literature so far used geometric and/or anatomic information derived from structural MRI and/or DTI data only. In this paper, we take a novel, alternative multimodal approach of combining resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) and DTI data, and propose to use functional coherence as the criterion to guide the clustering of fibers derived from DTI tractography. Specifically, the functional coherence between two streamline fibers is defined as their rsfMRI time series' correlations, and the affinity propagation (AP) algorithm is used to cluster DTI-derived streamline fibers into bundles. Currently, we use the corpus callosum (CC) fibers, which are the largest fiber bundle in the brain, as a test-bed for methodology development and validation. Our experimental results have shown that the proposed rsfMRI-guided fiber clustering method can achieve functionally homogeneous bundles that are reasonably consistent across individuals and populations, suggesting the close relationship between structural connectivity and brain function. The clustered fiber bundles were evaluated and validated via the benchmark data provided by task-based fMRI, via reproducibility studies, and via comparison with other methods. Finally, we have applied the proposed framework on a multimodal rsfMRI/DTI dataset of schizophrenia (SZ) and reproducible results were obtained.","Resting state fMRI, DTI, fiber clustering, tract-based analysis",validate/evaluate against larger datasets

The ideal “virtual laboratory” for such multicellular systems simulates both the biochemical microenvironment (the “stage”) and many mechanically and biochemically interacting cells (the “players” upon the stage). PhysiCell—physics-based multicellular simulator—is an open source agent-based simulator that provides both the stage and the players for studying many interacting cells in dynamic tissue microenvironments. It builds upon a multi-substrate biotransport solver to link cell phenotype to multiple diffusing substrates and signaling factors.

PhysiCell has been parallelized with OpenMP, and its performance scales linearly with the number of cells. Simulations up to 105-106 cells are feasible on quad-core desktop workstations; larger simulations are attainable on single HPC compute nodes. We demonstrate PhysiCell by simulating the impact of necrotic core biomechanics, 3-D geometry, and stochasticity on the dynamics of hanging drop tumor spheroids and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast.

However, new monitoring techniques, such as high-resolution time-lapse video microscopy, facilitate tracking and quantitative analysis of single cells and their progeny. Information on cellular development, divisional history and differentiation are naturally comprised into a pedigree-like structure, denoted as cellular genealogy. To extract reliable information concerning effecting variables and control mechanisms underlying cell fate decisions, it is necessary to analyse a large number of cellular genealogies.

Materials and methods: Here, we propose a set of statistical measures that are specifically tailored for the analysis of cellular genealogies. These measures address the degree and symmetry of cellular expansion, as well as occurrence and correlation of characteristic events such as cell death. Furthermore, we discuss two different methods for reconstruction of lineage fate decisions and show their impact on the interpretation of asymmetric developments. In order to illustrate these techniques, and to circumvent the present shortage of available experimental data, we obtain cellular genealogies from a single-cell-based mathematical model of haematopoietic stem cell organization.

Results and conclusions: Based on statistical analysis of cellular genealogies, we conclude that effects of external variables, such as growth conditions, are imprinted in their topology. Moreover, we demonstrate that it is essential to analyse timing of cell fate-specific changes and of occurrence of cell death events in the divisional context in order to understand the mechanisms of lineage commitment.","cell lineage, cell geneology, stem cell, phylogeny, phylogenetic tree",---

Background: Vortices that form during LV filling have specific geometry and anatomical locations that are critical determinants of directed blood flow during ejection. Therefore, it is clinically relevant to assess the vortex flow patterns to better understand the LV function.
Methods: Twenty-five patients (10 normal and 15 patients with abnormal LV systolic function) underwent CE with intravenous contrast agent, Definity (Bristol-Myers Squibb Medical Imaging, Inc., North Billerica, Massachusetts). The velocity vector and vorticity were estimated by particle image velocimetry. Average vortex parameters including vortex depth, transverse position, length, width, and sphericity index were measured. Vortex pulsatility parameters including relative strength, vortex relative strength, and vortex pulsation correlation were also estimated.
Results: Vortex depth and vortex length were significantly lower in the abnormal LV function group (0.443 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.482 +/- 0.06, p < 0.05; 0.366 +/- 0.06 vs. 0.467 +/- 0.05, p < 0.01, respectively). Vortex width was greater (0.209 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.128 +/- 0.06, p < 0.01) and sphericity index was lower (1.86 +/- 0.5 vs. 3.66 +/- 0.6, p < 0.001) in the abnormal LV function group. Relative strength (1.13 +/- 0.4 vs. 2.10 +/- 0.8, p < 0.001), vortex relative strength (0.57 +/- 0.2 vs. 1.19 +/- 0.5, p < 0.001), and vortex pulsation correlation (0.63 +/- 0.2 vs. 1.31 +/- 0.5, p < 0.001) were significantly lower in the abnormal LV function group.
Conclusions: It was feasible to quantify LV vorticity arrangement by CE using particle image velocimetry in normal subjects and those with LV systolic dysfunction, and the vorticity imaging by CE may serve as a novel approach to depict vortex, the principal quantity to assess the flow","left ventricle, color coding, heatmap, rainbow map, vortices, flow visualization",--

In some cases, it makes sense to map the genome sequence onto a space-filling curve (e.g., Hilbert curve [2], [27]) to produce a compact overview of the genome. Further, some examples have been published in which the genome was mapped onto (simu-lated) 3D spatial coordinates [81], for example, to visualize genome folding [16] and to provide an illustration of the genome's plasticity. While the Gosling grammar can easily be extended to support these two layouts, the utility of these layouts in the context of a grammar is limited as they do not afford alignment with other tracks. We will explore support for space-filling and 3D layouts in the future. Another limitation of Gosling concerning the taxonomy by Nusrat et al. [53] is that it currently only supports mapping to the entire genome sequence. It does not support sequence abstraction, i.e., it is not possible to filter out regions, such as intragenic regions, or to scale genomic regions of different lengths to a unit length. We intend to add support for such functionality in the future. Finally, we plan to conduct a controlled user study with members of our target audience to assess the grammar's learnability and overall ease-of-use."

Results were quantified by kinetic energy, mitral valve velocity profiles and root-mean-square errors of velocity.

One domain where this task is crucial is in bioinformatics, where the energy landscape that organizes three-dimensional structures of a molecule by their energetics is a powerful construct. The landscape can be leveraged, among other things, to reveal macrostates where a molecule is biologically-active. This is a daunting task, as landscapes of complex actuated systems, such as molecules, are inherently high-dimensional. Nonetheless, our laboratories have made some progress via topological and statistical analysis of spatial data over the recent years. We have proposed what is essentially a dichotomy, methods that are more pertinent for visualization-driven discovery, and methods that are more pertinent for discovery of the biologically-active macrostates but not amenable to visualization. In this paper, we present a novel, hybrid method that combines strengths of these methods, allowing both visualization of the landscape and discovery of macrostates. We demonstrate what the method is capable of uncovering in comparison with existing methods over structure spaces sampled with conformational sampling algorithms.

Our technique visualizes annotated patterns too small to be identifiable at certain zoom levels using insets, i.e., magnified thumbnail views of the annotated patterns. Insets support users in searching, comparing, and contextualizing patterns while reducing the amount of navigation needed.

CellML is an XML format designed to encode biophysically based systems of ordinary differential equations and both linear and non-linear algebraic equations. A primary design goal of CellML is to allow mathematical models to be encoded in a modular and reusable format to aid reproducibility and interoperability of modeling studies. In OpenCMISS, we make use of CellML models to enable users to configure various aspects of their multi-scale physiological models. This avoids the need for users to be familiar with the OpenCMISS internal code in order to perform customized computational experiments. Examples of this are: cellular electrophysiology models embedded in tissue electrical propagation models; material constitutive relationships for mechanical growth and deformation simulations; time-varying boundary conditions for various problem domains; and fluid constitutive relationships and lumped-parameter models. In this paper, we provide implementation details describing how CellML models are integrated into multi-scale physiological models in OpenCMISS. The external interface OpenCMISS presents to users is also described, including specific examples exemplifying the extensibility and usability these tools provide the physiological modeling and simulation community. We conclude with some thoughts on future extension of OpenCMISS to make use of other community developed information standards, such as FieldML, SED-ML, and BioSignalML.

For 3D data, this is even more challenging as these contain large point-sets that are spatially distributed and may change over time. In certain cases, animation can be useful, although this also provides little insight when there are a large number of changes happening concurrently.

In addition to temporally resolved 3D genome structure data, it is now also possible to measure not only pairwise but also n-way interactions of regions across the whole genome. This will require novel visualization techniques that enable analysts to navigate this highly complex space and select lower-dimensional slices for visualization. A related challenge is the visualization and integration of imaging data (ranging from standard lightfield microscopy to super-resolution microscopy) with genomics data from chromosome conformation capture assays such as Hi-C. The mapping between image-based and genome-based coordinates and corresponding navigation will be particularly challenging in this context."

Traditionally, a lot of MedViz research has been focused on the visualization of a single, unimodal patient dataset, being usually defined on a regular grid in 3D and capturing a selected part of the human anatomy. As a prominent example, volume rendering has been extensively studied, together with advanced lighting simulation, etc. In recent years, however, the most pressing challenges in MedViz have broadened, not at the least paralleling new developments in image acquisition, and being associated with a growing data complexity, and advances in medical diagnosis and patient treatment. It is now becoming increasingly common, that several datasets are acquired, also at different points in time, and that in-vivo information, related to physiology, is complementing the more traditional anatomical information. Different imaging modalities are applied and whole-body scans facilitate the screening for disease and amplify the opportunities of forensic pathology. Data may also be measured or computed in a numerical simulation over complex grids, e.g., in ultrasound imaging or in the simulation of blood flow in cerebral and aortic aneurysms. All this data needs to be integrated with the anatomical scans. While traditional MedViz usually focuses on data of a single patient, the large data pools that are acquired in longitudinal cohort studies, for example, in epidemiology, involving hundreds to thousands of individuals (the cohort) pose tremendous new challenges. These include the combined visualization of image and non-image data as well as the integrated visualization of heterogeneous data. The effective and efficient interactive exploration of large medical data requires innovative technology and dedicated interaction techniques such as table-top user interfaces and gesture-based interaction. In this tutorial, we discuss the above-mentioned modern challenges in MedViz, followed by examples of and strategies for the development of new solutions to cope with these challenges with respect to specific (clinical) problems. We explore a variety of advanced MedViz topics. In particular, we discuss the interactive visualization of whole-body medical volume data, visualization techniques addressing the readability problem of Ultrasound by enriching the data with other types of medical data, the visualization of more abstract physiological data in its anatomical context, and the interactive visual analysis of heterogeneous image-centric cohort study data.

Animation is a natural choice to display time-dependent medical image data or unsteady biomedical simulation data where the dynamic nature of the data is mapped to a kind of video. Animation, however, may also be employed for static data, e.g., to move a camera along a predefined path to convey complex anatomical structures or the spatial relations around a pathology. Clipping planes may be smoothly translated and object transparency adapted to control visibility and further support emphasis of spatial relations, e.g., around a tumor. Virtual endoscopy, where the virtual camera is moved inside an air-filled or fluid-filled structure, is a prominent example of animating static data. Animations, however, are complex visualizations that may depict a larger number of changes in a short period of time. Thus, we also consider cognitive limitations, e.g., change blindness, and discuss methods to reduce the complexity of animations. Emphasis techniques may guide the viewer’s attention and improve the perception of essential features. Finally, interaction beyond the typical video recorder functionality is considered.

",,rispoli.jpg,"Rispoli, Vinicius C.; Nielsen, Jon F.; Nayak, Krishna S.; Carvalho, Joao L. A.","Background: Phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging (PC-MRI) is used clinically for quantitative assessment of cardiovascular flow and function, as it is capable of providing directly-measured 3D velocity maps. Alternatively, vascular flow can be estimated from model-based computation fluid dynamics (CFD) calculations. CFD provides arbitrarily high resolution, but its accuracy hinges on model assumptions, while velocity fields measured with PC-MRI generally do not satisfy the equations of fluid dynamics, provide limited resolution, and suffer from partial volume effects. The purpose of this study is to develop a proof-of-concept numerical procedure for constructing a simulated flow field that is influenced by both direct PC-MRI measurements and a fluid physics model, thereby taking advantage of both the accuracy of PC-MRI and the high spatial resolution of CFD. The use of the proposed approach in regularizing 3D flow fields is evaluated.
Methods: The proposed algorithm incorporates both a Newtonian fluid physics model and a linear PC-MRI signal model. The model equations are solved numerically using a modified CFD algorithm. The numerical solution corresponds to the optimal solution of a generalized Tikhonov regularization, which provides a flow field that satisfies the flow physics equations, while being close enough to the measured PC-MRI velocity profile. The feasibility of the proposed approach is demonstrated on data from the carotid bifurcation of one healthy volunteer, and also from a pulsatile carotid flow phantom.
Results: The proposed solver produces flow fields that are in better agreement with direct PC-MRI measurements than CFD alone, and converges faster, while closely satisfying the fluid dynamics equations. For the implementation that provided the best results, the signal-to-error ratio (with respect to the PC-MRI measurements) in the phantom experiment was 6.56 dB higher than that of conventional CFD; in the in vivo experiment, it was 2.15 dB higher.
Conclusions: The proposed approach allows partial or complete measurements to be incorporated into a modified CFD solver, for improving the accuracy of the resulting flow fields estimates. This can be used for reducing scan time, increasing the spatial resolution, and/or denoising the PC-MRI measurements.","blood flow, CFD, simulation, color coded, vector field visualization",--

In this paper, we describe a novel set of interaction techniques that make it easier to explore and interpret such pathways. Specifically, our application allows neuroscientists to place and interactively manipulate box or ellipsoid-shaped regions to selectively display pathways that pass through specific anatomical areas. These regions can be used in coordination with a simple and flexible query language which allows for arbitrary combinations of these queries using Boolean logic operators. A representation of the cortical surface is provided for specifying queries of pathways that may be relevant to gray matter structures and for displaying activation information obtained from functional magnetic resonance imaging. By precomputing the pathways and their statistical properties, we obtain the speed necessary for interactive question-and-answer sessions with brain researchers.

The pump function was reflected on the changes in the flow structure represented by the flow axis line distribution and the acceleration along the flow axis line. The acceleration of the ejection had three modes, “A”, “B” and “C”, and generated by the wall dynamic events. “A” appeared from the apical to the outflow area along the main flow axis line, “B” along the anterior mitral leaflet and the branched flow axis line, and “C” generated by the high speed vortex behind the mitral valve.

This is achieved via unifying two partial differential equations allowing for a straightforward, fast and accurate implementation. Comparing the results for modelling haptotactic-chemotactic cancer growth using the common choice of the environment and the above introduced exclusion of the MDE, we observe a rather similar size of the tumour. The shape of the cancer modelled with the novel introduced method shows a more diffusive character, i.e. the cells are migrating farther from the bulk, constituting the high malignancy of the tumour. This diffuse tumour behaviour is very characteristic for this type of cancer as it has already been shown for in-vitro experiments.

The components that are typically considered are usually nutrients, like oxygen and glucose, matrix degrading enzymes (MDE) and the extracellular matrix (ECM). The in vivo processes are very complex and occur on different levels. This in turn leads to huge computational costs. Thus, the aim is to describe the processes on the basis of simplified mathematical approaches, which depict realistic results at the same time. In this work we discuss if we have to model the MDEs or if the ECM can be modelled directly depending on the cancer cells distribution.

",,wan.jpg,"Wan, Y.; Hansen, C.","Research on microscopy data from developing biological samples usually requires tracking individual cells over time. When cells are three-dimensionally and densely packed in a time-dependent scan of volumes, tracking results can become unreliable and uncertain. Not only are cell segmentation results often inaccurate to start with, but it also lacks a simple method to evaluate the tracking outcome. Previous cell tracking methods have been validated against benchmark data from real scans or artificial data, whose ground truth results are established by manual work or simulation. However, the wide variety of real-world data makes an exhaustive validation impossible. Established cell tracking tools often fail on new data, whose issues are also difficult to diagnose with only manual examinations. Therefore, data-independent tracking evaluation methods are desired for an explosion of microscopy data with increasing scale and resolution. In this paper, we propose the uncertainty footprint, an uncertainty quantification and visualization technique that examines nonuniformity at local convergence for an iterative evaluation process on a spatial domain supported by partially overlapping bases. We demonstrate that the patterns revealed by the uncertainty footprint indicate data processing quality in two algorithms from a typical cell tracking workflow – cell identification and association. A detailed analysis of the patterns further allows us to diagnose issues and design methods for improvements. A 4D cell tracking workflow equipped with the uncertainty footprint is capable of self diagnosis and correction for a higher accuracy than previous methods whose evaluation is limited by manual examinations.","cell tracking, uncertainty", concentrate our efforts on a comprehensive tracking system that can support a broad range of microscopy data.

To overcome these limitations, the proposed approach supports automatic tracking of identified features of interest (FOIs) in the time domain and, thus, facilitates quantitative analysis processes in a semiautomatic manner. Moreover, it allows us to visualize the movement of the patella in the femoral groove during an active flexion and extension movement, which is essential to assess kinematics with respect to knee flexions. To further support quantitative analysis, we propose kinematic plots and time-angle profiles, which enable comparative dynamics visualization. As a result, our proposed visualization approach facilitates better understanding of the effects of surgical interventions by quantifying and comparing the dynamics before and after the operations. We demonstrate our approach using clinical time-varying patellofemoral data, discuss its benefits with respect to quantification as well as medical reporting, and describe how to generalize it to other complex joint movements.","4D CT, quantitative analysis, feature identification and matching","kinematics profiles for other joints (e.g., shoulder), general profiles for abnormal movement patterns"

However, the lamina is integrated within a network of lipids, proteins and chromatin; the interdependence of this network poses a challenge to defining the individual mechanical contributions of these components. Here, we isolate the role of chromatin in nuclear mechanics by using a system lacking lamins. Using novel imaging analyses, we observe that untethering chromatin from the inner nuclear membrane results in highly deformable nuclei in vivo, particularly in response to cytoskeletal forces. Using optical tweezers, we find that isolated nuclei lacking inner nuclear membrane tethers are less stiff than wild-type nuclei and exhibit increased chromatin flow, particularly in frequency ranges that recapitulate the kinetics of cytoskeletal dynamics. We suggest that modulating chromatin flow can define both transient and long-lived changes in nuclear shape that are biologically important and may be altered in disease.","nuclear envelope, microscopy imaging, force microscopy, tweezing techniques, illustration, visual communication ",--

Note that visualizations of functional connectivity rely heavily on graph theory---an analytic language suitably concerned with describing the connections between nodes rather than the specific spatial paths connecting them. When the visualized unit becomes the connection between two points rather than the points themselves, novel possibilities emerge for representing connexels in a single image. This insight shifted functional connectivity visualizations from more traditional, anatomically situated representations to figures that focused their content on the graph of node-links or edges. functional connectivity visualization has routinely prioritized anatomical clarity in visualizations over the complexity of connexels

on functional connectivity dynamics: ""We have thus far addressed the problem of visualizing the three-dimensional space of connections, taking for granted the stability of the functional connectome. An additional dimension is required when the temporal domain is brought into the image along with the spatial (Fig. 8). Early approaches to illustrating brain activity over time used color coded ROIs with representative time-series (Fig. 8a) (Fox et al., 2005) or coherence plots (Fig. 8b) (Chang and Glover, 2010). More recent depictions of the whole brain over time make use of a left-to-right montage, with brains shifting along the series to reveal dynamic changes (Fig. 8d) (Handwerker et al., 2012, Majeed et al., 2011; see Figs. 4 & 6 from Majeed et al., 2009) or correlation matrices (Fig. 8e) (Allen et al., 2012a). However, when anatomical space is not the priority of a visualization, correlations (Fig. 8c) (Hutchison et al., in press) offer another means of conveying the temporal complexity of signal dynamics through broad color motifs. Although there has been limited use of videos as supplementary online material, the medium offers the potential to maintain a stable anatomical position, which allows for the representation of fluctuations along the temporal dimension. AFNI has made a script5 available to create videos6 of data dynamics shown on the cortical surface.""",,margulies.jpg,"Margulies, D.S.; Böttger, J.; Watanabe, A.; Gorgolewski, K.J.","Innovations in data visualization punctuate the landmark advances in human connectome research since its beginnings. From tensor glyphs for diffusion-weighted imaging, to advanced rendering of anatomical tracts, to more recent graph-based representations of functional connectivity data, many of the ways we have come to understand the human connectome are through the intuitive insight these visualizations enable. Nonetheless, several unresolved problems persist. For example, probabilistic tractography lacks the visual appeal of its deterministic equivalent, multimodal representations require extreme levels of data reduction, and rendering the full connectome within an anatomical space makes the contents cluttered and unreadable. In part, these challenges require compromises between several tensions that determine connectome visualization practice, such as prioritizing anatomic or connectomic information, aesthetic appeal or information content, and thoroughness or readability. To illustrate the ongoing negotiation between these priorities, we provide an overview of various visualization methods that have evolved for anatomical and functional connectivity data. We then describe interactive visualization tools currently available for use in research, and we conclude with concerns and developments in the presentation of connectivity results.","connectomics, brain, neuroscience","continue research that combines modalities, intuitivie interactions, means of processing ever more complex data, include more work with dynamics of functional connectome (add more of time element)"

Regions with a similar chromatin state interact with each other more frequently than expected based on their genomic distance.

This data has to be visualized whitin its anatomical context - the brain - in order to have an spatial impression of the position of the activation. To that end, multi-volume visualization must be supported.

Those patterns of potentially important imaging properties of the parameter space may be critical for the analysis. Standard approaches, such as transfer functions and juxtapositioned visualizations, fail to convey the shape of the multiparametric parameter distribution in sufficient detail. For these reasons, in this paper we present an approach that aims to enable the exploration and analysis of such multiparametric studies using an interactive visual analysis application to remedy the trade-offs between details in the value domain and in spatial resolution. Interactive probing within or across subjects allows for a digital biopsy that is able to uncover multiparametric tissue properties.

An inverse analysis was performed to identify a suitable constitutive model and the corresponding optimal parameter set.
