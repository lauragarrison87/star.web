""We describe an abstract protein space in the context of membrane protein-lipid interaction and we propose six levels of detail for both lipid types and the PLI abstract space. The visual design of the abstract space simplifies the PLI challenge and helps users obtain insight into the PLI. The LoD lipid representations reduce clutter caused by lipid particles. The LoD PLI space representations enable users to investigate the PLI space at the desired LoD. We also introduce a number of useful user options to aid the PLI visualization""",alharbi.png,"Alharbi, Naif; Krone, M.; Chavent, M.; Laramee, R.","In Molecular Dynamics (MD) Visualization, representative surfaces of varying resolution are commonly used to depict protein molecules while a variety of geometric shapes, ribbons, and spheres are used to represent residues and atoms at different levels of detail (LoD). The focus of the visualization is usually on individual atoms or molecules themselves and less often on the interaction space between them. Here we focus on LoD interaction between lipids and proteins and the space in which this occurs in the context of a membrane simulation. With naive approaches, particles may overlap and significant interaction details can be obscured due to clutter. Furthermore, the spatial complexity of the protein-lipid interaction (PLI) increases over time. Co-developed with an MD domain expert, we address the challenge of visualizing complex, time-dependent interactions between lipids and proteins by introducing two abstract LoD representations with six levels of detail for lipid molecules and protein interaction. We also propose a fast GPU-based projection that maps lipid-constituents involved in the interaction onto the abstract LoD protein interaction space. The tool provides fast LoD, the imagery of PLI for 336,260 particles over almost 2,000 time-steps. The result is a great simplification in both perception and cognition of this complex interaction that reveals new patterns and insight for computational biologists. We also report feedback from the domain expert to our visualization.","Scientific visualization, Molecular Dynamics, Protein-lipid Interaction","In future work, we aim to focus more on analysis. Discrete abstract rings can be employed to visualize protein deformation. Properties of cylinder shape can be exploited to map the PLI from a cylinder onto a 2D plane. Visual analytic techniques can be applied to 2D PLI results to understand the relation between residues and particles involved in the interaction.",--,n,

In this paper a three dimensional (3D) model of the Human Ventricular System (HVS) is used to investigate the flow of CSF within the human brain, using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). CSF can be modelled as a Newtonian Fluid and its flow through the HVS can be visualized using CFD. In this investigation a 3D geometric model of the HVS is constructed from MRI data. It is the only model of its type to date. The flow of CSF within the HVS is a complicated phenomenon due to the complex HVS geometry. Understanding the nature of CSF flow allows engineers and physicians to design medical techniques and drugs to treat various HVS complications, such as hydrocephalus as a result of a tumour.","flow visualization, particles, streamlines",---,10.1109/DFMA.2006.296914,n,

We successfully imaged motion of the biceps brachii and triceps brachii muscles during elbow flexion and extension in seven unimpaired adult subjects using real-time PC MRI. Results: The velocity data demonstrate that the biceps brachii and the triceps brachii, antagonistic muscles, move in opposite directions during elbow flexion and extension with velocity values in the muscle tissue ranging from –10 to _x0001_10 cm/second.

However, in all modeling studies reported so far numerous simplifications were made in terms of representing biophysical details of cellular function and its heterogeneity, gross anatomy and tissue microstructure, as well as the bidirectional coupling between electrophysiology (EP) and tissue distension. One limiting factor is the employed spatial discretization methods which are not sufficiently flexible to accommodate complex geometries or resolve heterogeneities, but, even more importantly, the limited efficiency of the prevailing solver techniques which are not sufficiently scalable to deal with the incurring increase in degrees of freedom (DOF) when modeling cardiac electromechanics at high spatio-temporal resolution. This study reports on the development of a novel methodology for solving the nonlinear equation of finite elasticity using human whole organ models of cardiac electromechanics, discretized at a high para-cellular resolution. Three patient-specific, anatomically accurate, whole heart EM models were reconstructed from magnetic resonance (MR) scans at resolutions of 220 μm, 440 μm and 880 μm, yielding meshes of approximately 184.6, 24.4 and 3.7 million tetrahedral elements and 95.9, 13.2 and 2.1 million displacement DOF, respectively. The same mesh was used for discretizing the governing equations of both electrophysiology (EP) and nonlinear elasticity. A novel algebraic multigrid (AMG) preconditioner for an iterative Krylov solver was developed to deal with the resulting computational load. The AMG preconditioner was designed under the primary objective of achieving favorable strong scaling characteristics for both setup and solution runtimes, as this is key for exploiting current high performance computing hardware. Benchmark results using the 220 μm, 440 μm and 880 μm meshes demonstrate efficient scaling up to 1024, 4096 and 8192 compute cores which allowed the simulation of a single heart beat in 44.3, 87.8 and 235.3 minutes, respectively. The efficiency of the method allows fast simulation cycles without compromising anatomical or biophysical detail.","Cardiac Electromechanics, Algebraic Multigrid, Parallel Computing, Whole Heart Model",---,10.1016/j.jcp.2015.10.045,n,y

It produces three-dimensional, time-resolved datasets containing both flow speed and direction for each voxel. In order to perform qualitative and quantitative data analysis on these datasets, a vessel segmentation is often required. These segmentations are mostly performed manually or semi-automatically, based on three-dimensional intensity images containing the maximal flow speed over all time steps. To allow for a faster segmentation, we propose a method that, in addition to intensity, incorporates the flow trajectories into the segmentation process. This is accomplished by extracting Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) from the flow data, which indicate physical boundaries in a dynamical system. To approximate LCS in our discrete images, we employ Finite Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE) fields to quantify the rate of separation of neighboring flow trajectories. LCS appear as ridges or valleys in FTLE images, indicating the presence of either a flow structure boundary or physical boundary.

Materials and Methods: 4D PC-MRI was performed in 11 patients with AscAD (46.3 6 22.0 years) and 10 healthy volunteers (32.9 6 13.4 years) after written informed consent and institutional review board approval. Following manual vessel wall segmentation of the ascending aorta (MATLAB, The Mathworks, Natick, MA), a 3D surface was created using spline interpolation. Spatial WSS variation based on surface division in 12 segments and temporal variation were evaluated in AscAD and normal aortas. Visual analysis of flow patterns was performed based on streamlines and particle traces using EnSight (v9.0, CEI, Apex, NC). Results: AscAD was associated with significantly increased diastolic WSS, decreased systolic to diastolic WSS ratio, and delayed onset of peak WSS (all P < 0.001). Temporally averaged WSS was increased and peak systolic WSS was decreased. The maximum WSS in AscAD was on the anterior wall of the ascending aorta. Vortical flow with highest velocities along the anterior wall and increased helical flow during diastole were observed in AscAD compared with controls. Conclusion: Changes in WSS in the ascending aorta of AscAD correspond to observed alterations in flow patterns compared to controls.","streamlines, slice rendering",---,10.1002/jmri.22485,n,

Furthermore, we offer a user-friendly front-end web server that integrates SeqCode functions with other graphical analysis tools. Our analysis and visualization toolkit represents a significant improvement in terms of performance and usability as compare to other existing programs.

The analysis of long simulations of molecular dynamics produces a large number of voids which have to be further explored and evaluated. In this paper we propose three new methods: two of them convey important properties along the long axis of a selected void during molecular dynamics and one provides a comprehensive picture across the void. The first two proposed methods use a specific heat map to present two types of information: an overview of all detected tunnels in the dynamics and their bottleneck width and stability over time, and an overview of a specific tunnel in the dynamics showing the bottleneck position and changes of the tunnel length over time. These methods help to select a small subset of tunnels, which are explored individually and in detail. For this stage we propose the third method, which shows in one static image the temporal evolvement of the shape of the most critical tunnel part, i.e., its bottleneck. This view is enriched with abstract depictions of different physicochemical properties of the amino acids surrounding the bottleneck. The usefulness of our newly proposed methods is demonstrated on a case study and the feedback from the domain experts is included.

Because these two steps are inherently linked, we adopt the so-called region-based joint detection-estimation (JDE) framework that addresses this joint issue using a multivariate inference for detection and estimation. JDE is built by making use of a regional bilinear generative model of the BOLD response and constraining the parameter estimation by physiological priors using temporal and spatial information in a Markovian model. In contrast to previous works that use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques to sample the resulting intractable posterior distribution, we recast the JDE into a missing data framework and derive a variational expectation-maximization (VEM) algorithm for its inference. A variational approximation is used to approximate the Markovian model in the unsupervised spatially adaptive JDE inference, which allows automatic fine-tuning of spatial regularization parameters. It provides a new algorithm that exhibits interesting properties in terms of estimation error and computational cost compared to the previously used MCMC-based approach. Experiments on artificial and real data show that VEM-JDE is robust to model misspecification and provides computational gain while maintaining good performance in terms of activation detection and hemodynamic shape recovery.","small multiples, color coded, time curve, heatmap",---,10.1109/TMI.2012.2225636,n,

Such data have shown potential to improve diagnosis and risk assessment of various cardiovascular diseases. Hereby, a unique way of analysing patient-specific haemodynamics becomes possible. However, these measurements are susceptible to artifacts, noise and a coarse spatio-temporal resolution. Furthermore, typical flow visualization techniques rely on interpolation. For example, using pathlines requires a high quality temporal resolution. While numerical simulations, based on mathematical flow models, address some of these limitations, the involved modelling assumptions (e.g., regarding the inflow and mesh) do not provide patientspecific data to the degree actual measurements would. To overcome this issue, data assimilation techniques can be applied to use measured data in order to steer a physically-based simulation of the flow, combining the benefits of measured data and simulation. Our work builds upon such an existing solution to increase the temporal resolution of the measured data, but achieves significantly higher fidelity. We avoid the previous damping and interpolation bias towards one of the measurements, by simulating bidrectionally (forwards and backwards through time) and using sources and sinks.

Typically PC-MRI data is visualized using stream- or pathlines. However, time-varying aspects of the data, e.g., vortex shedding, breakdown, and formation, are not sufficiently captured by these visualization techniques. Experimental flow visualization techniques introduce a visible medium, like smoke or dye, to visualize flow aspects including time-varying aspects. We propose a framework that mimics such experimental techniques by using a high number of particles. The framework offers great flexibility which allows for various visualization approaches. These include common traditional flow visualizations, but also streak visualizations to show the temporal aspects, and uncertainty visualizations. Moreover, these patient-specific measurements suffer from noise artifacts and a coarse resolution, causing uncertainty. Traditional flow visualizations neglect uncertainty and, therefore, may give a false sense of certainty, which can mislead the user yielding incorrect decisions.

For a typical 4mm isotropic voxel resolution, this results in connectivity networks with more than twenty thousand nodes and over 400 million links.

Current modeling approaches are usually confined to intra-patient registration of 3D image data representing the individual patient’s anatomy at different breathing phases. We propose an approach to generate a mean motion model of the lung based on thoracic 4D computed tomography (CT) data of different patients to extend the motion modeling capabilities. Our modeling process consists of three steps: an intra-subject registration to generate subject-specific motion models, the generation of an average shape and intensity atlas of the lung as anatomical reference frame, and the registration of the subject-specific motion models to the atlas in order to build a statistical 4D mean motion model (4D-MMM). Furthermore, we present methods to adapt the 4D mean motion model to a patient-specific lung geometry. In all steps, a symmetric diffeomorphic nonlinear intensity-based registration method was employed. The Log-Euclidean framework was used to compute statistics on the diffeomorphic transformations. The presented methods are then used to build a mean motion model of respiratory lung motion using thoracic 4D CT data sets of 17 patients. We evaluate the model by applying it for estimating respiratory motion of ten lung cancer patients. The prediction is evaluated with respect to landmark and tumor motion, and the quantitative analysis results in a mean target registration error (TRE) of ? ? _x0002_ _x0003_ mm if lung dynamics are not impaired by large lung tumors or other lung disorders (e.g., emphysema). With regard to lung tumor motion, we show that prediction accuracy is independent of tumor size and tumor motion amplitude in the considered data set. However, tumors adhering to non-lung structures degrade local lung dynamics significantly and the model-based prediction accuracy is lower in these cases. The statistical respiratory motion model is capable of providing valuable prior knowledge in many fields of applications.

However, before this new data can be used in clinical studies or for diagnosis, it is important to develop a notion of the characteristics of typical flow structures. To support this process we developed a novel blood flow clustering and exploration method. The method builds on the concept of coherent flow structures. Coherence maps for crosssectional slices are defined to show the overall degree of coherence of the flow. In coherent regions the method summarizes the dominant blood flow using a small number of pathline representatives. In contrast to other clustering approaches the clustering is restricted to coherent regions and pathlines with low coherence values, which are not suitable for clustering and thus are not forced into clusters. The coherence map is based on the Finite-time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE). It is created on selected planes in the inflow respective outflow area of a region of interest. The FTLE value measures the rate of separation of pathlines originating from this plane. Different to previous work using FTLE we do not focus on separating extremal lines but on local minima and regions of low FTLE intensities to extract coherent flow. The coherence map and the extracted clusters serve as basis for the flow exploration. The extracted clusters can be selected and inspected individually. Their flow rate and coherence provide a measure for their significance. Switching off clusters reduces the amount of occlusion and reveals the remaining part of the flow. The non-coherent regions can also be explored by interactive manual pathline seeding in the coherence map.","pathlines, flow visualization, clustering, coherence maps",---,10.2312/vcbm.20161274,n,

The hemodynamic information is extracted from the 4D MRA dataset and transferred to the surface model using rigid registration where it can be visualized color-coded or dynamically over time.

Therefore, it is of main interest, to estimate the risk of rupture, to gain a deeper understanding of aneurysm genesis, and to plan an actual intervention, the surface morphology and the internal blood flow characteristics. Visual exploration is primarily used to understand such complex and variable type of data. Since the blood flow data is strongly influenced by the surrounding vessel morphology both have to be visually combined to efficiently support visual exploration. Since the flow is spatially embedded in the surrounding aneurysm surface, occlusion problems have to be tackled. Thereby, a meaningful visual reduction of the aneurysm surface that still provides morphological hints is necessary. We accomplish this by applying an adapted illustrative rendering style to the aneurysm surface. Our contribution lies in the combination and adaption of several rendering styles, which allow us to reduce the problem of occlusion and avoid most of the disadvantages of the traditional semi-transparent surface rendering, like ambiguities in perception of spatial relationships.

In this paper, we take a novel, alternative multimodal approach of combining resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) and DTI data, and propose to use functional coherence as the criterion to guide the clustering of fibers derived from DTI tractography. Specifically, the functional coherence between two streamline fibers is defined as their rsfMRI time series' correlations, and the affinity propagation (AP) algorithm is used to cluster DTI-derived streamline fibers into bundles. Currently, we use the corpus callosum (CC) fibers, which are the largest fiber bundle in the brain, as a test-bed for methodology development and validation. Our experimental results have shown that the proposed rsfMRI-guided fiber clustering method can achieve functionally homogeneous bundles that are reasonably consistent across individuals and populations, suggesting the close relationship between structural connectivity and brain function.

Tissue-scale dynamics emerge from systems of many interacting cells as they respond to and influence their microenvironment. The ideal “virtual laboratory” for such multicellular systems simulates both the biochemical microenvironment (the “stage”) and many mechanically and biochemically interacting cells (the “players” upon the stage). PhysiCell—physics-based multicellular simulator—is an open source agent-based simulator that provides both the stage and the players for studying many interacting cells in dynamic tissue microenvironments. It builds upon a multi-substrate biotransport solver to link cell phenotype to multiple diffusing substrates and signaling factors. It includes biologically-driven sub-models for cell cycling, apoptosis, necrosis, solid and fluid volume changes, mechanics, and motility “out of the box.” The C++ code has minimal dependencies, making it simple to maintain and deploy across platforms. PhysiCell has been parallelized with OpenMP, and its performance scales linearly with the number of cells. Simulations up to 105-106 cells are feasible on quad-core desktop workstations; larger simulations are attainable on single HPC compute nodes. We demonstrate PhysiCell by simulating the impact of necrotic core biomechanics, 3-D geometry, and stochasticity on the dynamics of hanging drop tumor spheroids and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast. We demonstrate stochastic motility, chemical and contact-based interaction of multiple cell types, and the extensibility of PhysiCell with examples in synthetic multicellular systems (a “cellular cargo delivery” system, with application to anti-cancer treatments), cancer heterogeneity, and cancer immunology. PhysiCell is a powerful multicellular systems simulator that will be continually improved with new capabilities and performance improvements.

The aims of this study was to evaluate its applicability in scanning and volume estimation of the gastric antrum in humans. Merhodr: Twenty patients with functional dyspepsia and 20 healthy controls, comparable with regard to gender, age, and smoking habits, agreed to be scanned while ingesting 500 ml of meat soup. A mechanical scanner with a 3.25-MHz transducer coupled to a tilting motor provided in 3sec multiple images of the antrum during fasting and 1, 10, and 30min postprandially. On a Unix work station planar contours of the antrum were selected and drawn manually before organ reconstruction and volume computation. Results: Two volume scans of 160 could not be analyzed due to air in the antrum. Up to 5 cm proximal to the pylorus, volumes could be computed in 95% of fasting samples and in 98% of postprandial samples, versus 8% and 75%, respectively, up to 7 cm proximal to the pylorus. We found no significant differences in antral volumes between dyspeptic patients and controls, either fasting or postprandially. Fasting antral volumes in Helicobacter pylori-positive dyspeptics were smaller than in H. pylori-negative patients (P = 0.02). Conclusions: Three-dimensional ultrasonography by use of a tilting motor makes non-invasive volume estimation of the gastric antrum possible without making assumptions about its geometry. In the present material no difference was found in antral volumes between patients with functional dyspepsia and controls.

To increase the moderate specificity of DCE-MRI, and therefore, the distinction of benign and malign ant tumors, the tumor's heterogeneity and the tumor's enhancement kinetics have to be evaluated. In clinical practice, the tumor's enhancement  kinetics are analyzed via time-intensity curves after manual placement of regions of interest (ROI). A substantial limitation of the ROI analysis is the inter-observervariability as well as the potential distortion of the ROI's average curve, e.g. if the ROI covers benign and malign ant tumor tissue. We present a visual analytics approach for breast tumors in DCE-MRI data that comprises a voxel wise glyph based overview and a region based analysis. The regions are extracted via region merging and each region contains voxels with similar perfusion characteristics. As a result, we avoid the inter observervariability and reduce distortion due to averaging over differently perfused tissue.

Moreover, the influence of similarity measurements and a potential region based exploration are discussed.

However, new monitoring techniques, such as high-resolution time-lapse video microscopy, facilitate tracking and quantitative analysis of single cells and their progeny. Information on cellular development, divisional history and differentiation are naturally comprised into a pedigree-like structure, denoted as cellular genealogy. To extract reliable information concerning effecting variables and control mechanisms underlying cell fate decisions, it is necessary to analyse a large number of cellular genealogies.

Materials and methods: Here, we propose a set of statistical measures that are specifically tailored for the analysis of cellular genealogies. These measures address the degree and symmetry of cellular expansion, as well as occurrence and correlation of characteristic events such as cell death. Furthermore, we discuss two different methods for reconstruction of lineage fate decisions and show their impact on the interpretation of asymmetric developments. In order to illustrate these techniques, and to circumvent the present shortage of available experimental data, we obtain cellular genealogies from a single-cell-based mathematical model of haematopoietic stem cell organization.

Results and conclusions: Based on statistical analysis of cellular genealogies, we conclude that effects of external variables, such as growth conditions, are imprinted in their topology. Moreover, we demonstrate that it is essential to analyse timing of cell fate-specific changes and of occurrence of cell death events in the divisional context in order to understand the mechanisms of lineage commitment.","cell lineage, cell geneology, stem cell, phylogeny, phylogenetic tree",---,10.1111/j.1365-2184.2009.00586.x,n,

Biclustering has been recognized as an effective method for discovering local temporal expression patterns and unraveling potential regulatory mechanisms. The general biclustering problem is NP-hard. In the case of time series this problem is tractable, and efficient algorithms can be used. However, there is still a need for specialized applications able to take advantage of the temporal properties inherent to expression time series, both from a computational and a biological perspective.
Findings: BiGGEsTS makes available state-of-the-art biclustering algorithms for analyzing expression time series. Gene Ontology (GO) annotations are used to assess the biological relevance of the biclusters. Methods for preprocessing expression time series and post-processing results are also included.

While covalent interactions impose the structural integrity of molecules, noncovalent interactions govern more subtle phenomena such as protein folding, bonding or self assembly. The understanding of these types of interactions is necessary for the interpretation of many biological processes and chemical design tasks. While traditionally the electron density is analyzed to interpret the quantum chemistry of a molecular system, noncovalent interactions are characterized by low electron densities and only slight variations of them - challenging their extraction and characterization. Recently, the signed electron density and the reduced gradient, two scalar fields derived from the electron density, have drawn much attention in quantum chemistry since they enable a qualitative visualization of these interactions even in complex molecular systems and experimental measurements. In this work, we present the first combinatorial algorithm for the automated extraction and characterization of covalent and noncovalent interactions in molecular systems. The proposed algorithm is based on a joint topological analysis of the signed electron density and the reduced gradient. Combining the connectivity information of the critical points of these two scalar fields enables to visualize, enumerate, classify and investigate molecular interactions in a robust manner. Experiments on a variety of molecular systems, from simple dimers to proteins or DNA, demonstrate the ability of our technique to robustly extract these interactions and to reveal their structural relations to the atoms and bonds forming the molecules.

Results: To address this need we developed OncoThreads, a tool for the visualization of longitudinal clinical and cancer genomics and other molecular data in patient cohorts. The tool visualizes patient cohorts as temporal heatmaps and Sankey diagrams that support the interactive exploration and ranking of a wide range of clinical and molecular features. This allows analysts to discover temporal patterns in longitudinal data, such as the impact of mutations on response to a treatment, for example, emergence of resistant clones.

There are few tools that provide visual information on the forces governing molecular docking. However, these tools, commonly restricted to close interaction between atoms, do not consider whole simulation paths, long-range distances and, importantly, do not provide visual cues for a quick and intuitive comprehension of the energy functions (modeling intermolecular interactions) involved.

Research in this field is hampered by a lack of techniques that allow quantification of tissue architecture and its development. To bridge this gap, we have established a procedure based on confocal laser scans, image processing, and three-dimensional tissue reconstruction, as well as quantitative mathematical modeling. As a proof of principle, we reconstructed and modeled liver regeneration in mice after damage by CCl4, a prototypical inducer of pericentral liver damage.We have chosen the regenerating liver as an example because of the tight link between liver architecture and function: the complex microarchitecture formed by hepatocytes and microvessels, i.e. sinusoids, ensures optimal exchange of metabolites between blood and hepatocytes. Our model captures all hepatocytes and sinusoids of a liver lobule during a 16 days regeneration process. The model unambiguously predicted a so-far unrecognized mechanism as essential for liver regeneration, whereby daughter hepatocytes align along the orientation of the closest sinusoid, a process which we named “hepatocyte-sinusoid alignment” (HSA). The simulated tissue architecture was only in agreement with the experimentally obtained data when HSA was included into the model and, moreover, no other likely mechanism could replace it. In order to experimentally validate the model of prediction of HSA, we analyzed the three-dimensional orientation of daughter hepatocytes in relation to the sinusoids.

Background: Vortices that form during LV filling have specific geometry and anatomical locations that are critical determinants of directed blood flow during ejection. Therefore, it is clinically relevant to assess the vortex flow patterns to better understand the LV function.
Methods: Twenty-five patients (10 normal and 15 patients with abnormal LV systolic function) underwent CE with intravenous contrast agent, Definity (Bristol-Myers Squibb Medical Imaging, Inc., North Billerica, Massachusetts).

Average vortex parameters including vortex depth, transverse position, length, width, and sphericity index were measured.

Results: Vortex depth and vortex length were significantly lower in the abnormal LV function group (0.443 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.482 +/- 0.06, p < 0.05; 0.366 +/- 0.06 vs. 0.467 +/- 0.05, p < 0.01, respectively).

The proposed solution is composed of multiple linked 2D and 3D views, enabling the interactive exploration and filtering of trajectories in an informed way. In the workflow, we focus on the practical aspects of the interactive visual analysis specific to ligand trajectories. We adapt the small multiples principle to resolve an overly large number of trajectories into smaller chunks that are easier to analyze. We describe how drill-down techniques can be used to create and store selections of the trajectories with desired properties, enabling the comparison of multiple datasets. In appropriately designed 2D and 3D views, biochemists can either observe individual trajectories or choose to aggregate the information into a functional boxplot or density visualization. Our solution is based on a tight collaboration with the domain experts, aiming to address their needs as much as possible. The usefulness of our novel approach is demonstrated by two case studies, conducted by the collaborating protein engineers.","Visualization, Tools, Data Visualization, Proteins, Trajectory, Three-dimensional Displays, Two Dimensional Displays

However, most existing tools are tailored to a specific problem or data type and offer limited customization, making it challenging to optimize visualizations for new analysis tasks or datasets. To address this challenge, we designed Gosling-a grammar for interactive and scalable genomics data visualization. Gosling balances expressiveness for comprehensive multi-scale genomics data visualizations with accessibility for domain scientists. Our accompanying JavaScript toolkit called Gosling.js provides scalable and interactive rendering. Gosling.js is built on top of an existing platform for web-based genomics data visualization to further simplify the visualization of common genomics data formats. We demonstrate the expressiveness of the grammar through a variety of real-world examples. Furthermore, we show how Gosling supports the design of novel genomics visualizations. An online editor and examples of Gosling.js, its source code, and documentation are available at https://gosling.js.org.","genomics, grammar, genes","While Gosling covers almost the entire taxonomy, Gosling currently lacks support for two rarely used layout techniques: space-filling curves and spatial 3D layouts. In some cases, it makes sense to map the genome sequence onto a space-filling curve (e.g., Hilbert curve [2], [27]) to produce a compact overview of the genome. Further, some examples have been published in which the genome was mapped onto (simu-lated) 3D spatial coordinates [81], for example, to visualize genome folding [16] and to provide an illustration of the genome's plasticity. While the Gosling grammar can easily be extended to support these two layouts, the utility of these layouts in the context of a grammar is limited as they do not afford alignment with other tracks. We will explore support for space-filling and 3D layouts in the future. Another limitation of Gosling concerning the taxonomy by Nusrat et al. [53] is that it currently only supports mapping to the entire genome sequence. It does not support sequence abstraction, i.e., it is not possible to filter out regions, such as intragenic regions, or to scale genomic regions of different lengths to a unit length. We intend to add support for such functionality in the future. Finally, we plan to conduct a controlled user study with members of our target audience to assess the grammar's learnability and overall ease-of-use.",10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114876,n,y

Residues are represented by one vertex only indicating its position and additional information defining the rotation. The atoms in the residues are generated on-the-fly on the GPU, exploiting the new graphics hardware geometry shader capabilities.

To address this workflow, we developed Loon, a visualization tool for analyzing drug screening data based on quantitative phase microscopy imaging. Loon visualizes both, derived data such as growth rates, and imaging data. Since the images are collected automatically at a large scale, manual inspection of images and segmentations is infeasible.

Here, we performed intracardiac blood flow simulations based on time-resolved computed tomography on three patients, and investigated the effect of the distribution of PV flow rate on the flow field in the left atrium and ventricle. A design-of-experiment approach was used, where PV flow rates were varied in a systematic manner.

Results were quantified by kinetic energy, mitral valve velocity profiles and root-mean-square errors of velocity.

They reduce the complexity of the overall biological network by partitioning it into smaller manageable parts. While this reduction of complexity is their biggest strength, it is, at the same time, their biggest weakness. By removing what is deemed not important for the primary function of the pathway, biologists lose the ability to follow and understand cross-talks between pathways. Considering these cross-talks is, however, critical in many analysis scenarios, such as judging effects of drugs. In this paper we introduce Entourage, a novel visualization technique that provides contextual information lost due to the artificial partitioning of the biological network, but at the same time limits the presented information to what is relevant to the analyst's task. We use one pathway map as the focus of an analysis and allow a larger set of contextual pathways. For these context pathways we only show the contextual subsets, i.e., the parts of the graph that are relevant to a selection. Entourage suggests related pathways based on similarities and highlights parts of a pathway that are interesting in terms of mapped experimental data. We visualize interdependencies between pathways using stubs of visual links, which we found effective yet not obtrusive. By combining this approach with visualization of experimental data, we can provide domain experts with a highly valuable tool. We demonstrate the utility of Entourage with case studies conducted with a biochemist who researches the effects of drugs on pathways. We show that the technique is well suited to investigate interdependencies between pathways and to analyze, understand, and predict the effect that drugs have on different cell types.","bucket view, visual link, parallel coordinates, heatmap, dendrogram",Integrate biomedical data from different domains,10.1109/TVCG.2013.154,y - upper grp,y

For a deeper understanding of the complex interdependencies between genes, it is important to bring gene expressions (measurements) into context with pathways. Pathways, which are models of biological processes, are available in online databases. In these databases, large networks are decomposed into small sub-graphs for better manageability. This simplification results in a loss of context, as pathways are interconnected and genes can occur in multiple instances scattered over the network. Our main goal is therefore to present all relevant information, i.e., gene expressions, the relations between expression and pathways and between multiple pathways in a simple, yet effective way. To achieve this we employ two different multiple-view approaches. Traditional multiple views are used for large datasets or highly interactive visualizations, while a 2.5D technique is employed to support a seamless navigation of multiple pathways which simultaneously links to the expression of the contained genes. This approach facilitates the understanding of the interconnection of pathways, and enables a non-distracting relation to gene expression data. We evaluated Caleydo with a group of users from the life science community. Users were asked to perform three tasks: pathway exploration, gene expression analysis and information comparison with and without visual links, which had to be conducted in four different conditions. Evaluation results show that the system can improve the process of understanding the complex network of pathways and the individual effects of gene expression regulation considerably. Especially the quality of the available contextual information and the spatial organization was rated good for the presented 2.5D setup.","visual link, closeup",Comparative analysis of multiple paths,10.1109/PACIFICVIS.2010.5429609,y-upper grp,"done, in molecular pathway - explore"

In this paper, we show how to further accelerate the construction and the rendering of the solvent excluded surface (SES) and the molecular skin surface (MSS). We propose several improvements to reduce the update times for displaying these molecular surfaces. First, we adopt a parallel approximate Voronoi diagram algorithm to compute the MSS. This accelerates the MSS computation by more than one order of magnitude on a single core. Second, we demonstrate that the contour-buildup algorithm is ideally suited for computing the SES due to its inherently parallel structure. For both parallel algorithms, we observe good scalability up to 8 cores and, thus, obtain interactive frame rates for molecular dynamics trajectories of up to twenty thousand atoms for the SES and up to a few thousand atoms for the MSS. Third, we reduce the rendering time for the SES using tight-fitting bounding quadrangles as rasterization primitives. These primitives also accelerate the rendering of the MSS. With these improvements, the interactive visualization of the MSS of dynamic trajectories of a few thousand atoms becomes for the first time possible. Nevertheless, the SES remains a few times faster than the MSS.","molecular skin surface, local molecular dynamics","patch clipping, more coarse-grained simulations",10.1111/j.1467-8659.2009.01693.x,y-upper group,done in molecule dynamics

This study aimed to explore the three-dimensional (3D) morphological changes of cirrhotic sinusoids by serial histological sections.
Methods: Cirrhosis was induced by tail vein injection of albumin in Wistar rats with a positive antibody. A total of 356 serial histological sections were prepared from liver tissue blocks of normal and cirrhotic rats. The optical microscope images were registered and reconstructed, and 3D reconstructions of the fine structures of fibrous tissues and sinusoids were subsequently visualized.
Results: The fibrosis area of the cirrhotic sample was 6-16 times that of the normal sample (P<0.001). Cirrhosis led to obvious changes in the distribution and morphology of sinusoids, which were mainly manifested as dilation, increased quantity and disordered distribution. Compared with normal liver, cirrhotic liver has a significantly increased volume ratio, number and volume of sinusoids (1.63-, 0.53-, and 1.75-fold, respectively, P<0.001). Furthermore, the samples were further divided into three zones according to the oxygen supply, and there were significant differences in the morphology of the sinusoids in the normal and cirrhotic samples (P<0.05). In particular, morphological parameters of the cirrhotic sinusoids near the portal area were obviously greater than those in the normal liver (P<0.05).
Conclusion: 3D morphological structures of hepatic sinusoids were reconstructed, and the adaptive microstructure changes of cirrhotic sinusoids were accurately measured, which has an important implications for the study of hepatic microcirculation and pathological changes of cirrhosis.","lab study, cirrhosis, pathology, histopatholoy, direct visualization",--,10.14670/HH-18-339,n,y

It further consists of 24 other less annotated organisms from the animal and plant kingdom. I hope that this tool will be useful by the wider community in biological sciences.

A major reason is that the dynamic relationship between proliferating and necrotic cell populations during vascularized tumor growth, and the associated extra- and intra-cellular protein outflux from these populations into blood circulation remains poorly understood. Complementary to experimental efforts, mathematical approaches have been employed to effectively simulate the kinetics of detectable surface proteins (e.g., CA-125) shed into the bloodstream. However, existing models can be difficult to tune and may be unable to capture the dynamics of non-extracellular proteins, such as those shed from necrotic and apoptosing cells.

Results: SigTools is an R-based genomic signals visualization package developed with two objectives: (i) to facilitate genomic signals exploration in order to uncover insights for later model training, refinement and development by including distribution and autocorrelation plots; (ii) to enable genomic signals interpretation by including correlation and aggregation plots.

However, information of cellular proximity and crosstalk is not directly captured by common single cell sequencing protocols. Computational methods, which search for pairs of cell types expressing compatible ligand–receptor (LR) pairs, have thus become a powerful approach for dissecting cellular crosstalk from scRNA-seq data
",crosstalker.jpg,"Nagai, James S; Leimkühler, Nils B; Schaub, Michael T; Schneider, Rebekka K; Costa, Ivan G","Motivation: Ligand-receptor (LR) network analysis allows the characterization of cellular crosstalk based on single cell RNA-seq data. However, current methods typically provide a list of inferred LR interactions and do not allow the researcher to focus on specific cell types, ligands or receptors. In addition, most of these methods cannot quantify changes in crosstalk between two biological phenotypes.
Results: CrossTalkeR is a framework for network analysis and visualisation of LR interactions. CrossTalkeR identifies relevant ligands, receptors and cell types contributing to changes in cell communication when contrasting two biological phenotypes, i.e. disease vs. homeostasis.

While intra-model uncertainty allows us to derive uncertainty based on a single modeling approach, inter-model uncertainty arises from the differences of the results of different approaches. To derive intra-model uncertainty we exploit the covariance matrix analysis. The inter-model uncertainty is derived by comparing the outcome of three standard kinetic PET modeling approaches. We derive and visualize this uncertainty to exploit it as a basis for changing model input parameters with the ultimate goal to reduce the modeling uncertainty and thus obtain a more realistic model of the tracer under investigation. To support this uncertainty reduction process, we visually link abstract and spatial data by introducing a novel visualization approach based on the ThemeRiver metaphor, which has been modified to support the uncertainty-aware visualization of parameter changes between spatial locations.

The definition of a BTV requires insight into tumour characteristics going beyond conventionally defined radiological abnormalities and anatomical features. Molecular and biochemical imaging techniques, like positron emission tomography, the use of Magnetic Resonance (MR) Imaging contrast agents or MR Spectroscopy deliver this information and support BTV delineation. MR Spectroscopy Imaging (MRSI) is the only non-invasive technique in this list. Studies with MRSI have shown that voxels with certain metabolic signatures are more susceptible to predict the site of relapse.

These data have a great potential in medical diagnosis, since diseases can be better discriminated and detected at an earlier stage compared to static image data. The wide-spread use of perfusion data is hampered by the lack of efficient evaluation methods. For each voxel, a time-intensity curve characterizes the enhancement of a contrast agent. Parameters derived from these curves characterize the perfusion and have to be integrated for diagnosis. The diagnostic evaluation of this multi-field data is challenging and time-consuming due to its complexity. For the visual analysis of such datasets, feature-based approaches allow to reduce the amount of data and direct the user to suspicious areas. We present an interactive visual analysis approach for the evaluation of perfusion data. For this purpose, we integrate statistical methods and interactive feature specification. Correlation analysis and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are applied for dimension reduction and to achieve a better understanding of the inter-parameter relations. Multiple, linked views facilitate the definition of features by brushing multiple dimensions using non-binary and composite brushes. The specification result is linked to all views establishing a focus+context style of visualization in 3D.

The building blocks of the model are individual deformable ellipsoidal cells, where movement depends on internal parameter state (cell size and stiffness) and on external cues from the neighboring cells, extracellular matrix, and chemical signals. Cell movement and deformation are calculated from equations of motion using the total force acting on each cell, ensuring that forces are balanced. The simulations show that the sorting patterns of prestalk and prespore cells, emerging during the slug stage, depend critically on the type of cell adhesion and not just on chemotactic differences between cells. This occurs because cell size and stiffness can prevent the otherwise faster cells from passing the slower cells. The patterns are distinctively different when the prestalk cells are more or less adhesive than the prespore cells. These simulations suggest that sorting is not solely due to differential chemotaxis, and that differences in both adhesion strength and type between different cell types play a very significant role, both in Dictyostelium and other systems.","slice rendering, density rendering, 3D view, animation",---,10.1016/j.jtbi.2008.05.004,n,

This is the first hard real-time simulation of this model, with 10 s of biological simulation time executed in 10 s wall-clock time. This surpasses best-published efforts on HPC neural simulators (3 × slowdown) and GPUs running optimized spiking neural network (SNN) libraries (2 × slowdown). Furthermore, the presented approach indicates that real-time processing can be maintained with increasing SNN size, breaking the communication barrier incurred by traditional computing machinery. Model results are compared to an established HPC simulator baseline to verify simulation correctness, comparing well across a range of statistical measures. Energy to solution and energy per synaptic event are also reported, demonstrating that the relatively low-tech SpiNNaker processors achieve a 10 × reduction in energy relative to modern HPC systems, and comparable energy consumption to modern GPUs. Finally, system robustness is demonstrated through multiple 12 h simulations of the cortical microcircuit, each simulating 12 h of biological time, and demonstrating the potential of neuromorphic hardware as a neuroscience research tool for studying complex spiking neural networks over extended time periods.","cortical simulation, hardware", extend simulation times and computational neuroscience research to explore long-term effects in the brain,10.1098/rsta.2019.0160,n,y

",rispoli.jpg,"Rispoli, Vinicius C.; Nielsen, Jon F.; Nayak, Krishna S.; Carvalho, Joao L. A.","Background: Phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging (PC-MRI) is used clinically for quantitative assessment of cardiovascular flow and function, as it is capable of providing directly-measured 3D velocity maps. Alternatively, vascular flow can be estimated from model-based computation fluid dynamics (CFD) calculations. CFD provides arbitrarily high resolution, but its accuracy hinges on model assumptions, while velocity fields measured with PC-MRI generally do not satisfy the equations of fluid dynamics, provide limited resolution, and suffer from partial volume effects. The purpose of this study is to develop a proof-of-concept numerical procedure for constructing a simulated flow field that is influenced by both direct PC-MRI measurements and a fluid physics model, thereby taking advantage of both the accuracy of PC-MRI and the high spatial resolution of CFD. The use of the proposed approach in regularizing 3D flow fields is evaluated.
Methods: The proposed algorithm incorporates both a Newtonian fluid physics model and a linear PC-MRI signal model. The model equations are solved numerically using a modified CFD algorithm. The numerical solution corresponds to the optimal solution of a generalized Tikhonov regularization, which provides a flow field that satisfies the flow physics equations, while being close enough to the measured PC-MRI velocity profile. The feasibility of the proposed approach is demonstrated on data from the carotid bifurcation of one healthy volunteer, and also from a pulsatile carotid flow phantom.
Results: The proposed solver produces flow fields that are in better agreement with direct PC-MRI measurements than CFD alone, and converges faster, while closely satisfying the fluid dynamics equations. For the implementation that provided the best results, the signal-to-error ratio (with respect to the PC-MRI measurements) in the phantom experiment was 6.56 dB higher than that of conventional CFD; in the in vivo experiment, it was 2.15 dB higher.
Conclusions: The proposed approach allows partial or complete measurements to be incorporated into a modified CFD solver, for improving the accuracy of the resulting flow fields estimates. This can be used for reducing scan time, increasing the spatial resolution, and/or denoising the PC-MRI measurements.","blood flow, CFD, simulation, color coded, vector field visualization",--,10.1186/s12938-015-0104-7,n,y

For data analysis, we present a web-based visualisation application that combines multiple linked 2D and 3D views that display the previously calculated data The central view, a novel enhanced sequence diagram that shows the calculated values, is linked to a traditional surface visualisation of the protein. This results in an interactive visualisation that is independent of the size of the underlying data, since the memory footprint of the aggregated data for visualisation is constant and very low, even if the raw input consisted of several terabytes.","molecular visualization, ligand interaction, heatmap",incorporate aggregated ligand paths to foster the understanding of the movement,10.1111/cgf.14386,n,y

It lets us understand a normal heart’s morphology and also explains the formation of congenital heart defects. However, learning cardiac embryology is difficult because the processes underlying the heart formation are complex. This complexity is caused by the fact that complicated organs like the heart are generated from only a couple of cells. Heart development isn’t easy to learn because students must understand the spatial arrangement of the anatomical structures and be able to perceive the dynamic evolution of these structures in its whole complexity. Students have traditionally studied heart development through either lectures or textbooks. But none of these teaching modalities adequately describes the spatiotemporal complexity of the heart’s development. To get an idea of the difficulty of such a description, see the sidebar “Development of Cardiac Outflow Tracts.” Classically, the descriptions are illustrated by sketches like Figure 1 that help us visualize or represent the spatiotemporal evolution of this phenomenon.1 However, such drawings and sketches aren’t effective because 2D pictures only give a partial impression of the objects’ geometry. Moreover, the dynamics of structural evolution can only be rendered with a limited sequence of static images. This inadequacy in representing complex spatial developments is a major limitation. As a result, researchers must undergo the tricky task of graphically illustrating the generation and temporal transformation of most cardiac structures. Fortunately, advanced computer graphics can provide substantial improvements for teaching medicine (see, for example, the special CG&Aissue on imaging in medical education2) by letting researchers design, model, visualize, and manipulate 3D objects as well as produce animated movies. This article shows how we created animated models to improve the understanding of the complex changes that occur during normal heart development.","mesh, animation",---,10.1109/38.974513,y-lower grp,

Therefore, early detection, monitoring, and accurate diagnosis of LV pathologies are of critical importance. Usually, global cardiac function parameters are used to assess the cardiac structure and function, although regional abnormalities are important biomarkers of several cardiac diseases. Regional motion of the myocardium, the muscular wall of the LV, can be captured in a non-invasive manner using the velocity-encoded magnetic resonance (MR) imaging method known as Tissue Phase Mapping (TPM). To analyze the complex motion pattern, one typically visualizes for each time step the radial, longitudinal, and circumferential velocities separately according to the American Heart Association (AHA) model, which makes the comprehension of the spatio-temporal pattern an extremely challenging cognitive task.

Structural biologists are able to build computational models of the immature and mature HIV, which are relatively accurate. However, they cannot model the process of HIV maturation, which is the transition between these two stages, with the same level of accuracy because of the missing information about this process.

",sorger.jpg,"Sorger, Johannes; Mindek, Peter; Klein, Tobias; Johnson, Graham; Viola, Ivan","A challenging problem in biology is the incompleteness of acquired information when visualizing biological phenomena. Structural biology generates detailed models of viruses or bacteria at different development stages, while the processes that relate one stage to another are often not clear. Similarly, the entire life cycle of a biological entity might be available as a quantitative model, while only one structural model is available. If the relation between two models is specified at a lower level of detail than the actual models themselves, the two models cannot be interpolated correctly. We propose a method that deals with the visualization of incomplete data information in the developmental or evolutionary states of biological mesoscale models, such as viruses or microorganisms. The central tool in our approach is visual abstraction. Instead of directly interpolating between two models that show different states of an organism, we gradually forward transform the models into a level of visual abstraction that matches the level of detail of the modeled relation between them. At this level, the models can be interpolated without conveying false information. After the interpolation to the new state, we apply the inverse transformation to the model’s original level of abstraction. To show the flexibility of our approach, we demonstrate our method on the basis of molecular data, in particular data of the HIV virion and the mycoplasma bacterium.","visual abstraction, illustrative visualization, differentiation, development, missing information, uncertainty visualization",A natural advancement for this method is the design of transitions for cases where the level of relationship knowledge varies between regions or categories of connected objects,10.2312/VCBM.20161267,n,"discuss in multiscale section of paper - beyond, where going between developmental stages of an entire organism with visual abstraction to create a continuous representation"

This facilitates spatio-temporally consistent estimation of motion as opposed to other registrationbased algorithms which estimate the motion by sequentially registering one frame to another. To facilitate image matching, an attribute vector (AV) is constructed for each point in the image, and is intended to serve as a “morphological signature” of that point. The AV includes intensity, boundary, and geometric moment invariants (GMIs). Hierarchical registration of two image sequences is achieved by using the most distinctive points for initial registration of two sequences and gradually adding less-distinctive points to refine the registration. Experimental results on real data demonstrate good performance of the proposed method for cardiac image registration and motion estimation.

We present an approach toward the quantification of pulmonary deformation via non-rigid registration of serial MR images of the lung using the variational framework implemented in the Insight toolkit. Conventional registration methods, as exemplified by a finite element implementation of the classic elastic matching technique, are shown to perform well over a set of vascular landmarks in the measurement of lung motion. This performance is maintained in an augmented system, which combines inhomogeneous material properties with the use of domain discretizations tailored to reflect the apparent geometry within the image and to reduce background effects.

A hybrid approach is used to model the cellular tumour progression, the development of the local nutrient concentration and of the density of the extracellular matrix (ECM). The resting microglia in primary brain tumours are activated and attracted by signals emitted by tumour cells, which are described by a partial differential equation. The secretion of matrix degrading enzymes from amoeboid immune cells can be modelled with the help of an additional term for the degradation of the ECM. This supports a more invasive migration of tumour cells. To our knowledge, we present for the first time a model of microglial cells in the context of tumour growth. The qualitative results are identical to the cell arrangements described in the literature. In addition, the comparison with in-vitro data matches in a qualitative manner. The proposed model, thus, represents a promising approach for modelling brain tumour growth at the cellular level in the light of the innate immune system.","molecule, tumor growth, immune system, glioma; microgliadynamic behaviour; neural activity; partial differential equations; probabilistic simulation; microscopic scale","As  for  future  work,  in  addition  to  the  extension  of  thismodel to a vascular approach, a quantitative evaluation ofin-vitro  experiments  has  to  be  done.

The approach allows them to visualize the frequency and locality of up to five-way interactions among six different organelles (endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, lysosome, peroxisome, mitochondria and lipid droplet), providing unexpected insights into the dynamics of these interactions.

For example, lipid metabolism is distributed between the endoplasmic reticulum for lipid synthesis, lipid droplets for storage and transport, mitochondria and peroxisomes for β-oxidation, and lysosomes for lipid hydrolysis and recycling1,2,3,4,5. It is increasingly recognized that organelle contacts have a vital role in diverse cellular functions5,6,7,8. However, the spatial and temporal organization of organelles within the cell remains poorly characterized, as fluorescence imaging approaches are limited in the number of different labels that can be distinguished in a single image9. Here we present a systems-level analysis of the organelle interactome using a multispectral image acquisition method that overcomes the challenge of spectral overlap in the fluorescent protein palette. We used confocal and lattice light sheet10 instrumentation and an imaging informatics pipeline of five steps to achieve mapping of organelle numbers, volumes, speeds, positions and dynamic inter-organelle contacts in live cells from a monkey fibroblast cell line. We describe the frequency and locality of two-, three-, four- and five-way interactions among six different membrane-bound organelles (endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, lysosome, peroxisome, mitochondria and lipid droplet) and show how these relationships change over time. We demonstrate that each organelle has a characteristic distribution and dispersion pattern in three-dimensional space and that there is a reproducible pattern of contacts among the six organelles, that is affected by microtubule and cell nutrient status. These live-cell confocal and lattice light sheet spectral imaging approaches are applicable to any cell system expressing multiple fluorescent probes, whether in normal conditions or when cells are exposed to disturbances such as drugs, pathogens or stress. This methodology thus offers a powerful descriptive tool and can be used to develop hypotheses about cellular organization and dynamics.","organelle interactome, network diagram, heatmap matrix ","Our visualization and quantification of dynamic contacts between six different organelles will allow targeted research into the molecular mechanisms that guide these relationships.

This approach should also be useful for identifying proteins that mediate or regulate contact site formation (for example, tethers)19.

Regions that show such correlated behavior are said to form resting-state networks (RSNs). RSNs have been investigated using seed-dependent functional connectivity maps and by using a number of model-free methods. However, examining RSNs across a group of subjects is still a complex task and often involves human input in selecting meaningful networks. Methodology/Principal Findings: We report on a voxel based model-free normalized cut graph clustering approach with whole brain coverage for group analysis of resting-state data, in which the number of RSNs is computed as an optimal clustering fit of the data. Inter-voxel correlations of time-series are grouped at the individual level and the consistency of the resulting networks across subjects is clustered at the group level, defining the group RSNs. We scanned a group of 26 subjects at rest with a fast BOLD sensitive fMRI scanning protocol on a 3 Tesla MR scanner. Conclusions/Significance: An optimal group clustering fit revealed 7 RSNs. The 7 RSNs included motor/visual, auditory and attention networks and the frequently reported default mode network. The found RSNs showed large overlap with recently reported resting-state results and support the idea of the formation of spatially distinct RSNs during rest in the human brain.","volume, slice rendering, color coded",---,10.1371/journal.pone.0002001,n,

Visual exploration of these fields provides comprehensive insight into the unsteady blood-flow behavior, and precedes a quantitative analysis of additional blood-flow parameters.

The difficult task of determining position and orientation along the view-direction is automated by a fitting approach, aligning the probe with the orientations of the velocity field.

Understanding the mechanisms controlling neural stem cell proliferation and differentiation will play a key role in the emerging fields of regenerative medicine and cancer therapeutics. Stem cell studies in vitro from 2-D image data are well established. Visualizing and analyzing large three dimensional images of intact tissue is a challenging task. It becomes more difficult as the dimensionality of the image data increases to include time and additional fluorescence channels. There is a pressing need for 5-D image analysis and visualization tools to study cellular dynamics in the intact niche and to quantify the role that environmental factors play in determining cell fate. Results: We present an application that integrates visualization and quantitative analysis of 5-D (x,y,z,t,c h a n n e l) and large montage confocal fluorescence microscopy images. The image sequences show stem cells together with blood vessels, enabling quantification of the dynamic behaviors of stem cells in relation to their vascular niche, with applications in developmental and cancer biology. Our application automatically segments, tracks, and lineages the image sequence data and then allows the user to view and edit the results of automated algorithms in a stereoscopic 3-D window while simultaneously viewing the stem cell lineage tree in a 2-D window. Using the GPU to store and render the image sequence data enables a hybrid computational approach. An inference-based approach utilizing user-provided edits to automatically correct related mistakes executes interactively on the system CPU while the GPU handles 3-D visualization tasks. Conclusions: By exploiting commodity computer gaming hardware, we have developed an application that can be run in the laboratory to facilitate rapid iteration through biological experiments.

When cells are three-dimensionally and densely packed in a time-dependent scan of volumes, tracking results can become unreliable and uncertain. Not only are cell segmentation results often inaccurate to start with, but it also lacks a simple method to evaluate the tracking outcome. Previous cell tracking methods have been validated against benchmark data from real scans or artificial data, whose ground truth results are established by manual work or simulation. However, the wide variety of real-world data makes an exhaustive validation impossible. Established cell tracking tools often fail on new data, whose issues are also difficult to diagnose with only manual examinations. Therefore, data-independent tracking evaluation methods are desired for an explosion of microscopy data with increasing scale and resolution. In this paper, we propose the uncertainty footprint, an uncertainty quantification and visualization technique that examines nonuniformity at local convergence for an iterative evaluation process on a spatial domain supported by partially overlapping bases. We demonstrate that the patterns revealed by the uncertainty footprint indicate data processing quality in two algorithms from a typical cell tracking workflow – cell identification and association. A detailed analysis of the patterns further allows us to diagnose issues and design methods for improvements.

However, accurate estimation of lung motion with respect to the respiratory phase is difficult due to various challenges in image registration, e.g., motion artifacts and large interslice thickness in 4D-CT. Meanwhile, the temporal coherence across respiration phases is usually not guaranteed in the conventional registration methods which consider each phase image in 4D-CT independently. To address these challenges, the authors present a unified approach to estimate the respiratory lung motion with two iterative steps.
Methods: First, the authors propose a novel spatiotemporal registration algorithm to align all phase images of 4D-CT (in low-resolution) to a high-resolution group-mean image in the common space. The temporal coherence of registration is maintained by a set of temporal fibers that delineate temporal correspondences across different respiratory phases. Second, a super-resolution technique is utilized to build the high-resolution group-mean image with more anatomical details than any individual phase image, thus largely alleviating the registration uncertainty especially in correspondence detection. In particular, the authors use the concept of sparse representation to keep the group-mean image as sharp as possible.
Results: The performance of our 4D motion estimation method has been extensively evaluated on both the simulated datasets and real lung 4D-CT datasets. In all experiments, our method achieves more accurate and consistent results in lung motion estimation than all other state-of-the-art approaches under comparison.
Conclusions: The authors have proposed a novel spatiotemporal registration method to estimate the lung motion in 4D-CT. Promising results have been obtained, which indicates the high applicability of our method in clinical lung cancer radiation therapy.","importance map, heatmap, uncertainty analysis ",--,10.1118/1.4790689,n,y

Here, using platinum replica electron microscopy, we show that mitochondria in cells are embedded in an interstitial cytoskeletal network that contains abundant unbranched actin filaments. Both spontaneous and induced mitochondrial constrictions typically associate with a criss-cross array of long actin filaments that comprise part of this interstitial network. Non-muscle myosin II is found adjacent to mitochondria but is not specifically enriched at the constriction sites. During ionomycin-induced mitochondrial fission, F-actin clouds colocalize with mitochondrial constriction sites, whereas dynamic myosin II clouds are present in the vicinity of constrictions.

The current version of Cellinker documents over 3700 human and 3200 mouse L–R protein–protein interactions (PPIs) and embeds a practical and convenient webserver with which researchers can decode intercellular communications based on scRNA-seq data. And over 400 endogenous small molecule (sMOL) related L–R interactions were collected as well. Moreover, to help with research on coronavirus (CoV) infection, Cellinker collects information on 16L–R PPIs involved in CoV–human interactions (including 12L–R PPIs involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection). In summary, Cellinker provides a user-friendly interface for querying, browsing and visualizing L–R interactions as well as a practical and convenient web tool for inferring intercellular communications based on scRNA-seq data. We believe this platform could promote intercellular communication research and accelerate the development of related algorithms for scRNA-seq studies.

We give a comprehensive assessment of the analytical tools of network topology and dynamics. The state-of-the-art use of chemical similarity, protein structure, protein–protein interaction, signaling, genetic interaction and metabolic networks in the discovery of drug targets is summarized. We propose that network targeting follows two basic strategies. The “central hit strategy” selectively targets central nodes/edges of the flexible networks of infectious agents or cancer cells to kill them. The “network influence strategy” works against other diseases, where an efficient reconfiguration of rigid networks needs to be achieved by targeting the neighbors of central nodes/edges. It is shown how network techniques can help in the identification of single-target, edgetic, multi-target and allo-network drug target candidates.

Even just at the intermediate scales of individual biomolecules exposed to cellular environments, instead of modeling entire cells, there is actually much that remains to be learned in terms of fundamental biophysics, and this is probably where physical models of cellular environments can have the greatest impact in the near future. However, as the understanding of biomolecular behavior in cells becomes more comprehensive, physical models could be coupled with kinetic network models to add reactivity and to access even longer timescales.

""The genome browser is an archetypal tool due to its historic role providing unified access 1D and 2D data but is evolving to integrate the new spatial data. By combining techniques from across the sciences, these data are closing the resolution gap around 20 nm, however each discipline has a distinct perspective reflected in the way they represent the data. Cellular biology focuses downward from physiology on sequence tracks, whereas the biochemistry gazes upward from nucleotides at macromolecular models. Neither perceives the whole and there remain structures in the data, between chromosome and chromatin, that are unsatisfactorily represented by either browser or 3D viewer. Bridging this visualization gap to provide a homogenized view of these genomic data presents specific challenges: defining a novel visual grammar; augmenting analysis at scale; arranging sensible viewpoints; and capturing the interactive reasoning.

Physical proximity can be represented as two-dimensional heat maps or matrices. From these, three-dimensional (3D) conformations of chromatin can be computed revealing coherent structures that highlight the importance of nonsequential relationships across genomic features. Mainstream genomic browsers have been classically developed to display compact, stacked tracks based on a linear, sequential, per-chromosome coordinate system. Genome-wide comparative analysis demands new approaches to data access and new layouts for analysis. The legibility can be compromised when displaying track-aligned second dimension matrices, which require greater screen space. Moreover, 3D representations of genomes defy vertical alignment in track-based genome browsers. Furthermore, investigation at previously unattainable levels of detail is revealing multiscale, multistate, time-dependent complexity. This article outlines how these challenges are currently handled in mainstream browsers as well as how novel techniques in visualization are being explored to address them. A set of requirements for coherent visualization of novel spatial genomic data is defined and the resulting potential for whole genome visualization is described.","genome, genomics, gene interactions",more important to maximize the use of the 3D data being produced by representing its detail rather than increasing immersion,10.1002/1873-3468.12778,n,done in molecular function

Note that visualizations of functional connectivity rely heavily on graph theory---an analytic language suitably concerned with describing the connections between nodes rather than the specific spatial paths connecting them. When the visualized unit becomes the connection between two points rather than the points themselves, novel possibilities emerge for representing connexels in a single image. This insight shifted functional connectivity visualizations from more traditional, anatomically situated representations to figures that focused their content on the graph of node-links or edges. functional connectivity visualization has routinely prioritized anatomical clarity in visualizations over the complexity of connexels

on functional connectivity dynamics: ""We have thus far addressed the problem of visualizing the three-dimensional space of connections, taking for granted the stability of the functional connectome. An additional dimension is required when the temporal domain is brought into the image along with the spatial (Fig. 8). Early approaches to illustrating brain activity over time used color coded ROIs with representative time-series (Fig. 8a) (Fox et al., 2005) or coherence plots (Fig. 8b) (Chang and Glover, 2010). More recent depictions of the whole brain over time make use of a left-to-right montage, with brains shifting along the series to reveal dynamic changes (Fig. 8d) (Handwerker et al., 2012, Majeed et al., 2011; see Figs. 4 & 6 from Majeed et al., 2009) or correlation matrices (Fig. 8e) (Allen et al., 2012a). However, when anatomical space is not the priority of a visualization, correlations (Fig. 8c) (Hutchison et al., in press) offer another means of conveying the temporal complexity of signal dynamics through broad color motifs. Although there has been limited use of videos as supplementary online material, the medium offers the potential to maintain a stable anatomical position, which allows for the representation of fluctuations along the temporal dimension. AFNI has made a script5 available to create videos6 of data dynamics shown on the cortical surface.""",margulies.jpg,"Margulies, D.S.; Böttger, J.; Watanabe, A.; Gorgolewski, K.J.","Innovations in data visualization punctuate the landmark advances in human connectome research since its beginnings. From tensor glyphs for diffusion-weighted imaging, to advanced rendering of anatomical tracts, to more recent graph-based representations of functional connectivity data, many of the ways we have come to understand the human connectome are through the intuitive insight these visualizations enable. Nonetheless, several unresolved problems persist. For example, probabilistic tractography lacks the visual appeal of its deterministic equivalent, multimodal representations require extreme levels of data reduction, and rendering the full connectome within an anatomical space makes the contents cluttered and unreadable. In part, these challenges require compromises between several tensions that determine connectome visualization practice, such as prioritizing anatomic or connectomic information, aesthetic appeal or information content, and thoroughness or readability. To illustrate the ongoing negotiation between these priorities, we provide an overview of various visualization methods that have evolved for anatomical and functional connectivity data. We then describe interactive visualization tools currently available for use in research, and we conclude with concerns and developments in the presentation of connectivity results.","connectomics, brain, neuroscience","continue research that combines modalities, intuitivie interactions, means of processing ever more complex data, include more work with dynamics of functional connectome (add more of time element)",10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.04.111,n,"done, in brain function"

In this article, methods used for the acquisition, visualization, and quantification of such datasets are reviewed and illustrated. Methods: Currently, the acquisition of 3D cine (4D) phase contrast velocity data, synchronized relative to both cardiac and respiratory movements takes about ten minutes or more, even when using parallel imaging and optimized pulse sequence design. The large resulting datasets need appropriate post processing for the visualization of multidirectional flow, for example as vector fields, pathlines or streamlines, or for retrospective volumetric quantification. Applications: Multidirectional velocity acquisitions have provided 3D visualization of large scale flow features of the healthy heart and great vessels, and have shown altered patterns of flow in abnormal chambers and vessels. Clinically relevant examples include retrograde streams in atheromatous descending aortas as potential thromboembolic pathways in patients with cryptogenic stroke and marked variations of flow visualized in common aortic pathologies. Compared to standard clinical tools, 4D velocity mapping offers the potential for retrospective quantification of flow and other hemodynamic parameters. Conclusions: Multidirectional, 3D cine velocity acquisitions are contributing to the understanding of normal and pathologically altered blood flow features. Although more rapid and user-friendly strategies for acquisition and analysis may be needed before 4D velocity acquisitions come to be adopted in routine clinical CMR, their capacity to measure multidirectional flows throughout a study volume has contributed novel insights into cardiovascular fluid dynamics in health and disease.",---,---,10.1186/1532-429X-13-7,n,"done, in blood flow "

For 3D data, this is even more challenging as these contain large point-sets that are spatially distributed and may change over time. In certain cases, animation can be useful, although this also provides little insight when there are a large number of changes happening concurrently.

In addition to temporally resolved 3D genome structure data, it is now also possible to measure not only pairwise but also n-way interactions of regions across the whole genome. This will require novel visualization techniques that enable analysts to navigate this highly complex space and select lower-dimensional slices for visualization.

Data visualization also plays an increasing role in how research is communicated.

This article outlines current and future grand challenges in bioinformatics data visualization, and announces the first publication venue dedicated to this subdiscipline.","grand challenges in physiology, physiology visualization, multiscale visualization ","challenges that O'Donoghue identifies:
1) spatiotemporal organization of chromosomes at molecular resolution (genomics)--understanding this will transform our understanding of what gets transcribed, and how and when transcription is controlled in different cell types.
2) transcriptomics, rapid advances in single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) techniques now make it possible to track behaviors of individual cells in unprecedented detail, providing a window into events that were previously hidden. For example, scRNA-seq can be used to track cell differentiation and the evolution of cell-cell contacts during the growth of cancerous tumours. Also, in combination with imaging methods, these techniques can be used to resolve the spatial location of RNA transcripts within single cells (use this to understand the mechanisms that control cellular processes)
3) proteomics, advances in high-throughput mass-spectroscopy have begun to provide first glimpses into the highly dynamic epiproteome, i.e., the set of all post-translational modifications (PTMs) made to all proteins in a cell
4) cell biology: determining the spatiotemporal organization of a human cell at molecular resolution, provide structural framework for molecular basis of cell behavior (find location of proteins with imaging and mass-spectrometry techniques, molecular structure with EM, transient complexes from sequence information or MD simulations)
5) tissue-scale imaging, e.g. 2-photon fluroescence microscopy, make 3D maps of mammal brains, track real-time movements of cells and subcellular structures within living tissues, including tumors. Combining these data with tissue-scale or whole-body kinetic modeling (Alqahtani, 2017) has potential to revolutionize our understanding of physiology and the body’s responses to events such as tumor growth or therapeutic interventions. However, extracting insight from such massive, complex datasets requires development of highly tailored, innovative visual analysis methods
6) comparing temporal changes in clinical records across cohorts, especially if including microbiome.

As a prominent example, volume rendering has been extensively studied, together with advanced lighting simulation, etc. In recent years, however, the most pressing challenges in MedViz have broadened, not at the least paralleling new developments in image acquisition, and being associated with a growing data complexity, and advances in medical diagnosis and patient treatment. It is now becoming increasingly common, that several datasets are acquired, also at different points in time, and that in-vivo information, related to physiology, is complementing the more traditional anatomical information. Different imaging modalities are applied and whole-body scans facilitate the screening for disease and amplify the opportunities of forensic pathology. Data may also be measured or computed in a numerical simulation over complex grids, e.g., in ultrasound imaging or in the simulation of blood flow in cerebral and aortic aneurysms. All this data needs to be integrated with the anatomical scans. While traditional MedViz usually focuses on data of a single patient, the large data pools that are acquired in longitudinal cohort studies, for example, in epidemiology, involving hundreds to thousands of individuals (the cohort) pose tremendous new challenges. These include the combined visualization of image and non-image data as well as the integrated visualization of heterogeneous data. The effective and efficient interactive exploration of large medical data requires innovative technology and dedicated interaction techniques such as table-top user interfaces and gesture-based interaction. In this tutorial, we discuss the above-mentioned modern challenges in MedViz, followed by examples of and strategies for the development of new solutions to cope with these challenges with respect to specific (clinical) problems.

Animations, however, are complex visualizations that may depict a larger number of changes in a short period of time. Thus, we also consider cognitive limitations, e.g., change blindness, and discuss methods to reduce the complexity of animations. Emphasis techniques may guide the viewer’s attention and improve the perception of essential features. Finally, interaction beyond the typical video recorder functionality is considered. In this paper, we give a survey of medical animations and discuss the research potential that arises. Although we focus on medicine, the discussion of a research agenda is partially based on cartography, where animation is widely used.","animation, medical illustration",--,10.1016/j.cag.2020.06.003,n,"done, in introduction, in organ function"

Perhaps it is timely to place CMR data visualization at the top of the research agenda in medical visualization.,10.1016/J.PBIOMOLBIO.2014.07.009,n,done in heart function
