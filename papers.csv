Simon, and Dharmendra S. Modha;In the quest for cognitive computing, we have built a massively parallel cortical simulator, C2, that incorporates a number of innovations in computation, memory, and communication. Using C2 on LLNL's Dawn Blue Gene/P supercomputer with 147. 456 CPUs and 144 TB of main memory, we report two cortical simulations { at unprecedented scale { that e®ectively saturate the entire memory capacity and refresh it at least every simulated second. The rst simulation consists of 1:6 billion neurons and 8:87 trillion synapses with experimentally-measured gray matter thalamocortical connectivity. The second simulation has 900 million neurons and 9 trillion synapses with probabilistic connectivity. We demonstrate nearly perfect weak scaling and attractive strong scaling. The simulations, which incorporate phenomenological spiking neurons, individual learning synapses, axonal delays, and dynamic synaptic channels, exceed the scale of the cat cortex, marking the dawn of a new era in the scale of cortical simulations.;EEG waveplot, heatmap, topographic plot;Human brain with better supercomputers

This way, it is possible to explore the flow without the occlusion. Moreover comparative visualization is possible by putting flow of  different time steps, or other varying properties, side by side.;;angelelli.jpg;Paolo Angelelli, and Helwig Hauser;Flows through tubular structures are common in many fields, including blood flow in medicine and tubular fluid flows in engineering. The analysis of such flows is often done with a strong reference to the main flow direction along the tubular boundary. In this paper we present an approach for straightening the visualization of tubular flow. By aligning the main reference direction of the flow, i.e., the center line of the bounding tubular structure, with one axis of the screen, we are able to natively juxtapose (1.) different visualizations of the same flow, either utilizing different flow visualization techniques, or by varying parameters of a chosen approach such as the choice of seeding locations for integration-based flow visualization, (2.) the different time steps of a time-dependent flow, (3.) different projections around the center line , and (4.) quantitative flow visualizations in immediate spatial relation to the more qualitative classical flow visualization. We describe how to utilize this approach for an informative interactive visual analysis. We demonstrate the potential of our approach by visualizing two datasets from different fields: an arterial blood flow measurement and a tubular gas flow simulation from the automotive industry.;comparative visualization, flow visualization, streamlines, shape deformation;

The method is based on ultrasound imaging, using a plane wave acquisition acquisition protocol, which produces high frame rate ensemble data that are efficiently processed to extract directional flow information not previously available based on conventional Doppler imaging. These data are then visualized using a tailored pathlet-based visualization approach, to convey the slice-contained dynamic movement of the blood in the heart. This is especially important when imaging patients with possible congenital heart diseases, who typically exhibit complex flow patterns that are challenging to interpret. With this approach, it now is possible for the first time to achieve a real-time integration-based visualization of 2D blood flow aspects based on ultrasonic imaging. We demonstrate our solution in the context of selected cases of congenital heart diseases in neonates, showing how our technique allows for a more accurate and intuitive visualization of shunt flow and vortices.;slice rendering, color coded, particles, flow visualization;---

The first stage of the process involves the use of a signal model that relates the measured magnetic resonance signal to the contrast agent concentration. Since the model requires knowledge of the longitudinal relaxation time T1, a novel optimization scheme is presented which ensures a reliable measurement. Pharmacokinetic modelling of the observed contrast agent uptake is then performed to obtain physiological parameters relating to microvessel leakage permeability and volume fraction and the assumptions made in the derivation of these parameters are discussed. A simple colour representation is utilized that enables the relevant physiological information to be conveyed to the clinician in a visually efficient and meaningful manner. A second representation, based on vector maps, is also devised and it is demonstrated how this can be used for malignant tumour segmentation. Finally, the procedure is applied to 14 pre- and post-chemotherapy breast cases to demonstrate the clinical value of the technique. In particular, the apparent improved representation of tissue vascularity when compared to conventional methods and the implications for this in treatment assessment are discussed.;color coded, slice rendering;Large, clinical, study  for validation

Flow is visualized as slices with vectors added directly into 3D model.;#NAME?;aroussi.jpg;A. Aroussi, L. Howden, M. Vloeberghs;The Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a biomedical fluid contained within the Central Nervous System (CNS). It is produced in the ventricular system within the brain and is contained between the meninges, which are membranes lining the brain and the inside of the spine and cranium. It has a major role as a damper that protects the head from injuries and transports biochemical elements and proteins inside the brain. In this paper a three dimensional (3D) model of the Human Ventricular System (HVS) is used to investigate the flow of CSF within the human brain, using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). CSF can be modelled as a Newtonian Fluid and its flow through the HVS can be visualized using CFD. In this investigation a 3D geometric model of the HVS is constructed from MRI data. It is the only model of its type to date. The flow of CSF within the HVS is a complicated phenomenon due to the complex HVS geometry. Understanding the nature of CSF flow allows engineers and physicians to design medical techniques and drugs to treat various HVS complications, such as hydrocephalus as a result of a tumour.;flow visualization, particles, streamlines;---

Asakawa, Krishna S. Nayak, Silvia S. Blemker, Scott L. Delp, John M. Pauly, Dwight G. Nishimura, and Garry E. Gold;Purpose: To test the feasibility of using real-time phase contrast (PC) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to track velocities (1–20 cm/second) of skeletal muscle motion. Materials and Methods: To do this we modified a fast real-time spiral PC pulse sequence to accommodate through-plane velocity encoding in the range of –20 to _x0001_20 cm/second. We successfully imaged motion of the biceps brachii and triceps brachii muscles during elbow flexion and extension in seven unimpaired adult subjects using real-time PC MRI. Results: The velocity data demonstrate that the biceps brachii and the triceps brachii, antagonistic muscles, move in opposite directions during elbow flexion and extension with velocity values in the muscle tissue ranging from –10 to _x0001_10 cm/second. Conclusion: With further development, real-time PC MRI may provide a means to analyze muscle function in individuals with neurologic or movement disorders who cannot actively complete the repeated motions required for dynamic MRI techniques, such as cine PC MRI, that are more commonly used in musculoskeletal biomechanics applications.;color coded, slice rendering;---

Researchers can now determine the distribution, behavior, and interactions of labeled chemical probes and proteins in live kidney tissue in real time without fixation artifacts. Chemical probes, such as fluorescently labeled dextrans, have extended our understanding of dynamic events with subcellular resolution. To accomplish expression of specific proteins in vivo, cDNAs of fluorescently labeled proteins have been cloned into adenovirus vectors and infused by micropuncture to induce proximal tubule cell infection and protein expression. The localization and intensity of the expressed fluorescent proteins can be observed repeatedly at different time points allowing for enhanced quantitative analysis while limiting animal use.

The purpose of this study is to develop a real-time three-dimensional biomechanical model of volumetric muscle based on modified Hill model for the active stress which is controlled from EMG recordings. Finite element model is used to estimate the passive behavior of the muscle and tendons during contraction. We demonstrate that this 3D model implementation is very cost effective with respect to the computation time and the simulation gives good results compared to real measured data. Thus, this effective implementation will allow implementing much more complex and realistic models considering the muscle as volumetric continuum, with moderate computation time.;animation, time curve, EMG;establish the geometrical model of muscles in lower extremities from MRI acquisitions

Bieging, Alex Frydrychowicz, Andrew Wentland, Benjamin R. Landgraf, Kevin M. Johnson, Oliver Wieben, and Christopher J. Francois;Purpose: To estimate surface-based wall shear stress (WSS) and evaluate flow patterns in ascending aortic dilatation (AscAD) using a high-resolution, time-resolved, three-dimensional (3D), three-directional velocity encoded, radially undersampled phase contrast MR sequence (4D PC-MRI). Materials and Methods: 4D PC-MRI was performed in 11 patients with AscAD (46.3 6 22.0 years) and 10 healthy volunteers (32.9 6 13.4 years) after written informed consent and institutional review board approval. Following manual vessel wall segmentation of the ascending aorta (MATLAB, The Mathworks, Natick, MA), a 3D surface was created using spline interpolation. Spatial WSS variation based on surface division in 12 segments and temporal variation were evaluated in AscAD and normal aortas. Visual analysis of flow patterns was performed based on streamlines and particle traces using EnSight (v9.0, CEI, Apex, NC). Results: AscAD was associated with significantly increased diastolic WSS, decreased systolic to diastolic WSS ratio, and delayed onset of peak WSS (all P < 0.001). Temporally averaged WSS was increased and peak systolic WSS was decreased. The maximum WSS in AscAD was on the anterior wall of the ascending aorta. Vortical flow with highest velocities along the anterior wall and increased helical flow during diastole were observed in AscAD compared with controls. Conclusion: Changes in WSS in the ascending aorta of AscAD correspond to observed alterations in flow patterns compared to controls.;streamlines, slice rendering;---

Stalder, Thorsten A. Bley, Hans Burkhardt, Jurgen Hennig, Michael Markl;Time-resolved phase contrast (PC) MRI with velocity encoding in three directions (flow-sensitive four-dimensional MRI) can be employed to assess three-dimensional blood flow in the entire aortic lumen within a single measurement. These data can be used not only for the visualization of blood flow but also to derive additional information on vascular geometry with three-dimensional PC MR angiography (MRA). As PCMRA is sensitive to available signal-to-noise ratio, standard and novel blood pool contrast agents may help to enhance PC-MRA image quality. In a group of 30 healthy volunteers, the influence of different contrast agents on vascular signalto- noise ratio, PC-MRA quality, and subsequent three-dimensional stream-line visualization in the thoracic aorta was determined. Flow-sensitive four-dimensional MRI data acquired with contrast agent provided significantly improved signal-to-noise ratio in magnitude data and noise reduction in velocity data compared to measurements without contrast media. The agreement of three-dimensional PC-MRA with reference standard contrast-enhanced MRA was good for both contrast agents, with improved PC-MRA performance for blood pool contrast agent, particularly for the smaller supraaortic branches. For three-dimensional flow visualization, a trend toward improved results for the data with contrast agent was observed.;streamlines, isosurface, volume;combined with calculated vessel geometry, and the determined vessel boundaries can be used for derivation of further hemodynamic parameters such as wall shear stress or pressure gradients

Among other fields, 4D MRI provides valuable data for the research of cardiac blood flow and with that the development, diagnosis, and treatment of various cardiac pathologies. However, to gain insights from larger research studies or to apply 4D MRI in the clinical routine later on, analysis techniques become necessary that allow to robustly identify important flow characteristics without demanding too much time and expert knowledge. Heart muscle contractions and the particular complexity of the flow in the heart imply further challenges when analyzing cardiac blood flow. Working toward the goal of simplifying the analysis of 4D MRI heart data, we present a visual analysis method using line predicates. With line predicates precalculated integral lines are sorted into bundles with similar flow properties, such as velocity, vorticity, or flow paths. The user can combine the line predicates flexibly and by that carve out interesting flow features helping to gain overview. We applied our analysis technique to 4D MRI data of healthy and pathological hearts and present several flow aspects that could not be shown with current methods. Three 4D MRI experts gave feedback and confirmed the additional benefit of our method for their understanding of cardiac blood flow.;streamlines, line predicates, isosurface;To further improve insight and overview, a reduction of line clutter could be achieved by displaying a line bundle’s flow behavior with less lines or more abstract methods.

Until recently, metabolic studies were dedicated to a single pathway, but current researches now consider the entire network. As matter stands, existing visualization tools cannot be used to undertake these global studies since they have been designed to probe metabolic pathways. For the purpose of making it feasible, this paper presents a graph drawing algorithm for the whole metabolic network. Our collaboration with biologists led us to introduce drawing constraints which take into account the decomposition of the network into metabolic pathways as well as biochemical textbook drawing conventions. These constraints raise numerous graph drawing problems which are solved by first recursively decomposing the network then applying suitable graph drawing algorithms. Finally, we present an application that illustrates the advantage of this representation when visualizing groups of reactions which span several metabolic pathways.;network, layout;Routing of edges at the end of the quotient graph drawing, focus+context methods

Broos, N.H.L.C. de Hoon, P.J.H. de Koning, R.J. van der Geest, A. Vilanova, and A.C. Jalba;Cardiac flow is still not fully understood, and is currently an active research topic. Using phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (PC-MRI) blood flow can be measured. For the inspection of such flow, researchers often rely on methods that require additional scans produced by different imaging modalities to provide context. This requires labor-intensive registration and often manual segmentation before any exploration of the data is performed. This work provides a framework that allows for a quick exploration of cardiac flow without the need of additional imaging and time-consuming segmentation. To achieve this, only the 4D data from one PC-MRI scan is used. A context visualization is derived automatically from the data, and provides context for the flow. Instead of relying on segmentation to deliver an accurate context, the heart’s ventricles are approximated by half-ellipsoids that can be placed with minimal user interaction. Furthermore, seeding positions for flow visualization can be placed automatically in areas of interest defined by the user and based on derived flow features. The framework enables a user to do a fast initial exploration of cardiac flow, as is demonstrated by a use case and a user study involving cardiac blood flow researchers.;pathlines, isosurfaces, color coded, sketching;---

Phillips Jr., and Michael Gleicher;In this paper, we present an approach to creating illustrations of molecular flexibility using normal mode analysis (NMA). The output of NMA is a collection of points corresponding to the locations of atoms and associated motion vectors, where a vector for each point is known. Our approach abstracts the complex object and its motion by grouping the points, models the motion of each group as an affine velocity, and depicts the motion of each group by automatically choosing glyphs such as arrows. Affine exponentials allow the extrapolation of non-linear effects such as near rotations and spirals from the linear velocities. Our approach automatically groups points by finding sets of neighboring points whose motions fit the motion model. The geometry and motion models for each group are used to determine glyphs that depict the motion, with various aspects of the motion mapped to each glyph. We evaluated the utility of our system in real work done by structural biologists both by utilizing it in our own structural biology work and quantitatively measuring its usefulness on a set of known protein conformation changes. Additionally, in order to allow ourselves and our collaborators to effectively use our techniques we integrated our system with commonly used tools for molecular visualization.;arrow glyphs;Perceptual design for using arrows

Byska and A. Jurcik and M. E. Groller and I. Viola, and B. Kozlikova;Studying the characteristics of proteins and their inner void space, including their geometry, physico-chemical properties and dynamics are instrumental for evaluating the reactivity of the protein with other small molecules. The analysis of long simulations of molecular dynamics produces a large number of voids which have to be further explored and evaluated. In this paper we propose three new methods: two of them convey important properties along the long axis of a selected void during molecular dynamics and one provides a comprehensive picture across the void. The first two proposed methods use a specific heat map to present two types of information: an overview of all detected tunnels in the dynamics and their bottleneck width and stability over time, and an overview of a specific tunnel in the dynamics showing the bottleneck position and changes of the tunnel length over time. These methods help to select a small subset of tunnels, which are explored individually and in detail. For this stage we propose the third method, which shows in one static image the temporal evolvement of the shape of the most critical tunnel part, i.e., its bottleneck. This view is enriched with abstract depictions of different physicochemical properties of the amino acids surrounding the bottleneck. The usefulness of our newly proposed methods is demonstrated on a case study and the feedback from the domain experts is included. The biochemists confirmed that our novel methods help to convey the information about the appearance and properties of tunnels in a very intuitive and comprehensible manner;heatmap, time curve, brushing;---

Because these two steps are inherently linked, we adopt the so-called region-based joint detection-estimation (JDE) framework that addresses this joint issue using a multivariate inference for detection and estimation. JDE is built by making use of a regional bilinear generative model of the BOLD response and constraining the parameter estimation by physiological priors using temporal and spatial information in a Markovian model. In contrast to previous works that use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques to sample the resulting intractable posterior distribution, we recast the JDE into a missing data framework and derive a variational expectation-maximization (VEM) algorithm for its inference. A variational approximation is used to approximate the Markovian model in the unsupervised spatially adaptive JDE inference, which allows automatic fine-tuning of spatial regularization parameters. It provides a new algorithm that exhibits interesting properties in terms of estimation error and computational cost compared to the previously used MCMC-based approach. Experiments on artificial and real data show that VEM-JDE is robust to model misspecification and provides computational gain while maintaining good performance in terms of activation detection and hemodynamic shape recovery.;small multiples, color coded, time curve;---

Crampin, Matthew Halstead, Peter Hunter, Poul Nielsen, Denis Noble, Nicolas Smith and Merryn Tawhai;Bioengineering analyses of physiological systems use the computational solution of physical conservation laws on anatomically detailed geometric models to understand the physiological function of intact organs in terms of the properties and behaviour of the cells and tissues within the organ. By linking behaviour in a quantitative, mathematically defined sense across multiple scales of biological organization – fromproteins to cells, tissues, organs and organ systems– these methods have the potential to link patient-specific knowledge at the two ends of these spatial scales. A genetic profile linked to cardiac ion channelmutations, for example, can be interpreted in relation to body surface ECG measurements via a mathematical model of the heart and torso, which includes the spatial distribution of cardiac ion channels throughout the myocardium and the individual kinetics for each of the approximately 50 types of ion channel, exchanger or pump known to be present in the heart. Similarly, linking molecular defects such asmutations of chloride ion channels in lung epithelial cells to the integrated function of the intact lung requires models that include the detailed anatomy of the lungs, the physics of air flow, blood flow and gas exchange, togetherwith the large deformationmechanics of breathing.Organizingthis largebody of knowledge into a coherent framework for modelling requires the development of ontologies, markup languages for encoding models, and web-accessible distributed databases. In this article we review the state of the field at all the relevant levels, and the tools that are being developed to tackle such complexity. Integrative physiology is central to the interpretation of genomic and proteomic data, and is becoming a highly quantitative, computer-intensive discipline.;---;---

Dabdoub, R. Wolfgang Rumpf, Amber D. Shindhelm, and William C.

This scheme is orthogonal to the Pathline-like human understanding of motion “this part of the molecule moved from here to here along this path”. We present MoFlow, a system for visualizing molecular motion using a Pathline-analogous representation. Results: The MoFlow system produces high-quality renderings of molecular motion as atom pathlines, as well as interactive WebGL visualizations, and 3D printable models. In a preliminary user study, MoFlow representations are shown to be superior to canonical representations for conveying molecular motion. Conclusions: Pathline-based representations of molecular motion are more easily understood than timeline representations. Pathline representations provide other advantages because they represent motion directly, rather than representing structure with inferred motion.;molecular shape, pathlines, color coded;comparative visualization for multiple molecules

During diastole, a normally-functioning mitral valve opens as a result of increased pressure from the left atrium. Exploration of mechanical differences of mitral valves in healthy patient and patients with pathological states are important for research and teaching. Dayan et al. \cite{dayan:2004}, created a model to produce animation of dynamics of mitral valve complex from the Visible Human project data set, and numeric motion-capture data. The normal and pathophysiologic dynamics can be compared and viewed from any perspective.;#NAME?;dayan.jpg;Joseph H. Dayan, Aaron Oliker, Ram Sharony, F. Gregory Baumann, Aubrey Galloway, Stephen B. Colvin, D. Craig Miller, Eugene A. Grossi;Objective: Three-dimensional motion-capture data offer insight into the mechanical differences of mitral valve function in pathologic states. Although this technique is precise, the resulting time-varying data sets can be both difficult to interpret and visualize. We used a new technique to transform these 3-dimensional ovine numeric analyses into an animated human model of the mitral apparatus that can be deformed into various pathologic states. Methods: In vivo, high-speed, biplane cinefluoroscopic images of tagged ovine mitral apparatus were previously analyzed under normal and pathologic conditions. These studies produced serial 3-dimensional coordinates. By using commercial animation and custom software, animated 3-dimensional models were constructed of the mitral annulus, leaflets, and subvalvular apparatus. The motion data wereoverlaid onto a detailed model of the human heart, resulting in a dynamic reconstruction. Results: Numeric motion-capture data were successfully converted into animated 3-dimensional models of the mitral valve. Structures of interest can be isolated by eliminating adjacent anatomy. The normal and pathophysiologic dynamics of the mitral valve complex can be viewed from any perspective. Conclusion: This technique provides easy and understandable visualization of the complex and time-varying motion of the mitral apparatus. This technology creates a valuable research and teaching tool for the conceptualization of mitral valve dysfunction and the principles of repair.;animation;---

However, development of good models and our intuition is hampered by the biological complexity. To be able to see how candidate models evolve in front of the user in an interactive virtual 3D cell at various zoom levels, therefore is a crucial aspect and a challenging problem. The motivation for creating the ZigCell3D software, is thus a holistic view ranging from being able to change model parameters, see how they affect 3D versions of the cell at molecular levels, while at the same time being able to verify the simulated model against a real experimental fluorescence microscopy image. ZigCell3D is a virtual 3D whiteboard approach to chemical reaction modelling. It aims to provide a realtime interactive environment, where complex biophysics research is turned into a creative and game-like 3D environment. The complete system entails modelling, simulation and visualisation as part of a unified framework. The core visualisation is based on a multi-core parallel C/C++ ray tracing engine, that builds a complete 3D iso-surface model of the cell, its organelles and molecules down to the atomic level using PDB files. The simulator itself is based on coarse-grained Brownian motion of the individual molecules, which is visualised in detail in a tightly coupled manner.

Recent advances have improved the speed and quality of the imaging data considerably. Nevertheless, the data remains compromised by noise and a lack of spatiotemporal resolution. Besides imaging data, also numerical simulations are employed. These are based on mathematical models of specific features of physical reality. However, these models require realistic parameters and boundary conditions based on measurements. We propose to use data assimilation to bring measured data and physically-based simulation together, and to harness the mutual benefits. The accuracy and noise robustness of the coupled approach is validated using an analytic flow field.

Eisemann, and A. Vilanova;Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) enables volumetric and time-varying measurements of blood-flow data. Such data have shown potential to improve diagnosis and risk assessment of various cardiovascular diseases. Hereby, a unique way of analysing patient-specific haemodynamics becomes possible. However, these measurements are susceptible to artifacts, noise and a coarse spatio-temporal resolution. Furthermore, typical flow visualization techniques rely on interpolation. For example, using pathlines requires a high quality temporal resolution. While numerical simulations, based on mathematical flow models, address some of these limitations, the involved modelling assumptions (e.g., regarding the inflow and mesh) do not provide patientspecific data to the degree actual measurements would. To overcome this issue, data assimilation techniques can be applied to use measured data in order to steer a physically-based simulation of the flow, combining the benefits of measured data and simulation. Our work builds upon such an existing solution to increase the temporal resolution of the measured data, but achieves significantly higher fidelity. We avoid the previous damping and interpolation bias towards one of the measurements, by simulating bidrectionally (forwards and backwards through time) and using sources and sinks. Our method is evaluated and compared to the, currently-used, conventional interpolation scheme and forward-only simulation using measured and analytical flow data. It reduces artifacts, noise, and interpolation error, while being closer to laminar flow, as is expected for flow in vessels.;flow visualization, arrows, isosurface;---

Pure tissue TACs are particularly difficult to obtain in the brain as the low resolution of PET means almost all voxels are a mixture of tissues. Factor analysis explicitly accounts for mixing but is an underdetermined problem that can give arbitrary results. A joint factor and kinetic analysis is proposed whereby factor analysis explicitly accounts for mixing of tissues. Hence, more meaningful parameters are obtained by the kinetic models, which also ensure a less ambiguous solution to the factor analysis.

In our approach, the topology of a human organ is represented by a skeleton in the form of a tree or cycled graph. The length of skeleton growth can be simulated by an algebraic L-system that also produces discrete events. The paper shows how to include global transformations into the formalism of L-systems to obtain a continuous process. The shape of the organ is approximated by a number of ellipsoidal clusters centred at points on the skeleton. The proposed growth model of the organ continually responds to the positional changes of surrounding organs, thereby changing the organ shape locally. In our study, the stomach of a human embryo is used for the demonstration of organ development, and the methodology employed is also applicable to the animation of animal organs and their development.;animation;---

Ewald, Hanne A. Askautrud, Morgan L. Truitt, Bryan E. Welm, Emma Bainbridge, George Peeters, Matthew F. Krummel, and Zena Werb;The tumor microenvironment consists of stromal cells and extracellular factors that evolve in parallel with carcinoma cells. To gain insights into the activities of stromal cell populations, we developed and applied multicolor imaging techniques to analyze the behavior of these cells within different tumor microenvironments in the same live mouse. We found that regulatory T-lymphocytes (Tregs) migrated in proximity to blood vessels. Dendriticlike cells, myeloid cells and carcinoma-associated fibroblasts all exhibited higher motility in the microenvironment at the tumor periphery than within the tumor mass. Since oxygen levels differ between tumor microenvironments, we tested if acute hypoxia could account for the differences in cell migration. Direct visualization revealed that Tregs ceased migration under acute systemic hypoxia, whereas myeloid cells continued migrating. In the same mouse and microenvironment, we experimentally subdivided the myeloid cell population and revealed that uptake of fluorescent dextran defined a low-motility subpopulation expressing markers of tumor-promoting, alternatively activated macrophages. In contrast, fluorescent anti-Gr1 antibodies marked myeloid cells patrolling inside tumor vessels and in the stroma. Our techniques allow real-time combinatorial analysis of cell populations based on spatial location, gene expression, behavior and cell surface molecules within intact tumors. The techniques are not limited to investigations in cancer, but could give new insights into cell behavior more broadly in development and disease.;experimental coloring;---

Current modeling approaches are usually confined to intra-patient registration of 3D image data representing the individual patient’s anatomy at different breathing phases. We propose an approach to generate a mean motion model of the lung based on thoracic 4D computed tomography (CT) data of different patients to extend the motion modeling capabilities. Our modeling process consists of three steps: an intra-subject registration to generate subject-specific motion models, the generation of an average shape and intensity atlas of the lung as anatomical reference frame, and the registration of the subject-specific motion models to the atlas in order to build a statistical 4D mean motion model (4D-MMM). Furthermore, we present methods to adapt the 4D mean motion model to a patient-specific lung geometry. In all steps, a symmetric diffeomorphic nonlinear intensity-based registration method was employed. The Log-Euclidean framework was used to compute statistics on the diffeomorphic transformations. The presented methods are then used to build a mean motion model of respiratory lung motion using thoracic 4D CT data sets of 17 patients. We evaluate the model by applying it for estimating respiratory motion of ten lung cancer patients. The prediction is evaluated with respect to landmark and tumor motion, and the quantitative analysis results in a mean target registration error (TRE) of ? ? _x0002_ _x0003_ mm if lung dynamics are not impaired by large lung tumors or other lung disorders (e.g., emphysema). With regard to lung tumor motion, we show that prediction accuracy is independent of tumor size and tumor motion amplitude in the considered data set. However, tumors adhering to non-lung structures degrade local lung dynamics significantly and the model-based prediction accuracy is lower in these cases. The statistical respiratory motion model is capable of providing valuable prior knowledge in many fields of applications. We present two examples of possible applications in radiation therapy and image guided diagnosis.;color coded, slice rendering, statistics;include the variability of the motion into the model

However, before this new data can be used in clinical studies or for diagnosis, it is important to develop a notion of the characteristics of typical flow structures. To support this process we developed a novel blood flow clustering and exploration method. The method builds on the concept of coherent flow structures. Coherence maps for crosssectional slices are defined to show the overall degree of coherence of the flow. In coherent regions the method summarizes the dominant blood flow using a small number of pathline representatives. In contrast to other clustering approaches the clustering is restricted to coherent regions and pathlines with low coherence values, which are not suitable for clustering and thus are not forced into clusters. The coherence map is based on the Finite-time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE). It is created on selected planes in the inflow respective outflow area of a region of interest. The FTLE value measures the rate of separation of pathlines originating from this plane. Different to previous work using FTLE we do not focus on separating extremal lines but on local minima and regions of low FTLE intensities to extract coherent flow. The coherence map and the extracted clusters serve as basis for the flow exploration. The extracted clusters can be selected and inspected individually. Their flow rate and coherence provide a measure for their significance. Switching off clusters reduces the amount of occlusion and reveals the remaining part of the flow. The non-coherent regions can also be explored by interactive manual pathline seeding in the coherence map.;pathlines, flow visualization, clustering, coherence maps;---

The high number of objects in a simulation requires advanced visualization techniques: first to handle the large data sets, second to support the human perception in the crowded environment, and third to provide an interactive exploration tool. To adjust the state of the cell to an external signal, a specific set of signaling molecules transports the information to the nucleus deep inside the cell. There, key molecules regulate gene expression. In contrast to continuous ODE models we model all signaling molecules individually in a more realistic crowded and disordered environment. Beyond spatiotemporal concentration profiles our data describes the process on a mesoscopic, molecular level, allowing a detailed view of intracellular events. In our proposed schematic visualization individual molecules, their tracks, or reactions can be selected and brought into focus to highlight the signal transduction pathway. Segmentation, depth cues and depth of field are applied to reduce the visual complexity. We also provide a virtual microscope to display images for comparison with wet lab experiments. The method is applied to distinguish different transport modes of MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling molecules in a cell.

Apopotosis, or programmed cell death, allows an organism to remove damaged or unneeded cells in a structured manner in contrast to necrosis. Ligands bind to the death receptors located on the cellular membrane forming ligand-receptor clusters. In this paper, we develop a novel mathematical model describing the stochastic process of the ligand-receptor clustering. To study the structure and the size of the ligand-receptor clusters, a stochastic particle simulation is employed. Besides the translation of the particles on the cellular membrane, we also take the particle rotation into account as we model binding sites explicitly. Glyph-based visualization techniques are used to validate and analyze the results of our in-silico model. Information on the individual clusters as well as particle-specific data can be selected by the user and is mapped to colors to highlight certain properties of the data. The results of our model look very promising. The visualization supports the process of model development by visual data analysis including the identification of cluster components as well as the illustration of particle trajectories.;network, particles;

Falk, M. Krone and T. Ertl;Molecular visualizations are a principal tool for analyzing the results of biochemical simulations. With modern GPU ray casting approaches it is only possible to render several millions of atoms at interactive frame rates unless advanced acceleration methods are employed. But even simplified cell models of whole-cell simulations consist of at least several billion atoms. However, many instances of only a few different proteins occur in the intracellular environment, which is beneficial in order to fit the data into the graphics memory. One model is stored for each protein species and rendered once per instance. The proposed method exploits recent algorithmic advances for particle rendering and the repetitive nature of intracellular proteins to visualize dynamic results from mesoscopic simulations of cellular transport processes. We present two out-of-core optimizations for the interactive visualization of data sets composed of billions of atoms as well as details on the data preparation and the employed rendering techniques. Furthermore, we apply advanced shading methods to improve the image quality including methods to enhance depth and shape perception besides non-photorealistic rendering methods.;animation;Add rotation to the dynamics of protein

The principle idea is to consider a time-varying data set as a 3D array where each voxel contains a time-activity curve (TAC). We define and appraise three different TAC similarity measures. Based on these measures we introduce three methods to analyze and visualize time-varying data. The first method relates the whole data set to one template TAC and creates a 1D histogram. The second method extends the 1D histogram into a 2D histogram by taking the Euclidean distance between voxels into account. The third method does not rely on a template TAC but rather creates a 2D scatter-plot of all TAC data points via multi-dimensional scaling. These methods allow the user to specify transfer functions on the 1D and 2D histograms and on the scatter plot, respectively.

Thomas, S. van Sint Jan, S.Waters, M.Vicecnoti;Biomedical science and its allied disciplines are entering a new era in which computational methods and technologies are poised to play a prevalent role in supporting collaborative investigation of the human body. Within Europe, this has its focus in the virtual physiological human (VPH), which is an evolving entity that has emerged from the EuroPhysiome initiative and the strategy for the EuroPhysiome (STEP) consortium. The VPH is intended to be a solution to common infrastructure needs for physiome projects across the globe, providing a unifying architecture that facilitates integration and prediction, ultimately creating a framework capable of describing Homo sapiens in silico. The routine reliance of the biomedical industry, biomedical research and clinical practice on information technology (IT) highlights the importance of a tailor-made and robust IT infrastructure, but numerous challenges need to be addressed if the VPH is to become a mature technological reality. Appropriate investment will reap considerable rewards, since it is anticipated that the VPH will influence all sectors of society, with implications predominantly for improved healthcare, improved competitiveness in industry and greater understanding of (patho)physiological processes. This paper considers issues pertinent to the development of the VPH, highlighted by the work of the STEP consortium.;---;---

Thorpe, and P. Rheingans;In macromolecules, an allosteric effect is said to occur when a change at one site of a molecule affects a distant site. Understanding these allosteric effects can be important for understanding how the functions of complex molecules such as proteins are regulated. One potential application of this knowledge is the development of small molecules that alter the function of proteins involved in diseases. Studying motional correlation can help researchers to discover how a change at a source site affects the target site and thus how allosteric ligands that could serve as drugs are able to exert their therapeutic effects. By improving our ability to analyze these correlated relationships, it may be possible to develop new medications to combat deadly diseases such as Hepatitis C. We present four visual techniques which represent motional correlation on rendered three-dimensional molecular models, providing new ways to view clusters of correlated residues and paths of allosteric interactions. These techniques give us a new way of investigating the presence of motional correlations in complex molecules. We compare each of these techniques to determine which are the most useful for representing motional correlations.;color coded, mesh;Extending by smooth geometric deformation

Moller, Heinz Handels, and Dennis Saring;Purpose: To present and evaluate the feasibility of a novel automatic method for generating 4D blood flow visualizations fusing high spatial resolution 3D and time-resolved(4D) magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) datasets. Materials and Methods: In a first step, the cerebrovascular system is segmented in the 3D MRA dataset and a surface model is computed. The hemodynamic information is extracted from the 4D MRA dataset and transferred to the surface model using rigid registration where it can be visualized color-coded or dynamically over time. The presented method was evaluated using software phantoms and 20 clinical datasets from patients with an arteriovenous malformation. Clinical evaluation was performed by comparison of Spetzler-Martin scores determined from the 4D blood flow visualizations and corresponding digital subtraction angiographies. Results: The performed software phantom validation showed that the presented method is capable of producing reliable visualization results for vessels with a minimum diameter of 2 mm for which a mean temporal error of 0.27 seconds was achieved. The clinical evaluation based on 20 datasets comparing the 4D visualization to DSA images revealed an excellent interrater reliability. Conclusion: The presented method enables an improved combined representation of blood flow and anatomy while reducing the time needed for clinical rating.;flow visualization, streamtubes, slice rendering;Improvement ifblood flow is artificially modeled for vessel structures with a diameter less than 2 mm

The transportation of ligand into the protein active site is often complex process, driven by geometric and physico-chemical properties, which renders the ligand path full of jitter and impasses. This prevents understanding of the ligand transportation and reasoning behind its behavior along the path. Results: To address the needs of the domain experts we design an explorative visualization solution based on a multi-scale simplification model. It helps to navigate the user to the most interesting parts of the ligand trajectory by exploring different attributes of the ligand and its movement, such as its distance to the active site, changes of amino acids lining the ligand, or ligand "stuckness". The process is supported by three linked views - 3D representation of the simplified trajectory, scatterplot matrix, and bar charts with line representation of ligand-lining amino acids. Conclusions: The usage of our tool is demonstrated on molecular dynamics simulations provided by the domain experts. The tool was tested by the domain experts from protein engineering and the results confirm that it helps to navigate the user to the most interesting parts of the ligand trajectory and to understand the ligand behavior.;flow visualization, simplified trajectory, color coded, scatterplot, boxplot, brushing;---

An effective visual exploration of several hemodynamic attributes like the wall shear stress (WSS) and the inflow jet is necessary to understand the hemodynamics. Moreover, the correlation between focus-and-context attributes is of particular interest. An expressive visualization of these attributes and anatomic information requires appropriate visualization techniques to minimize visual clutter and occlusions. We present the FLOWLENS as a focus-and-context approach that addresses these requirements. We group relevant hemodynamic attributes to pairs of focus-and-context attributes and assign them to different anatomic scopes. For each scope, we propose several FLOWLENS visualization templates to provide a flexible visual filtering of the involved hemodynamic pairs. A template consists of the visualization of the focus attribute and the additional depiction of the context attribute inside the lens. Furthermore, the FLOWLENS supports local probing and the exploration of attribute changes over time. The FLOWLENS minimizes visual cluttering, occlusions, and provides a flexible exploration of a region of interest. We have applied our approach to seven representative datasets, including steady and unsteady flow data from CFD simulations and 4D PC-MRI measurements. Informal user interviews with three domain experts confirm the usefulness of our approach.;flow visualization, pathlines, focus and context;Investigate how effective and expressive seeding strategies can be incorporated during the visual exploration

The inherent multi-modality of connectome datasets poses new challenges for data organization, integration, and sharing. We have designed and implemented the Connectome Viewer Toolkit - a set of free and extensible open source neuroimaging tools written in Python. The key components of the toolkit are as follows: (1) The Connectome File Format is an XML-based container format to standardize multi-modal data integration and structured metadata annotation. (2) The Connectome File Format Library enables management and sharing of connectome files. (3) The Connectome Viewer is an integrated research and development environment for visualization and analysis of multi-modal connectome data. The Connectome Viewer's plugin architecture supports extensions with network analysis packages and an interactive scripting shell, to enable easy development and community contributions. Integration with tools from the scientific Python community allows the leveraging of numerous existing libraries for powerful connectome data mining, exploration, and comparison.

GILJA, T. HAUSKEN, S. ODEGAARD & A. BERSTAD;We have developed and validated a three-dimensional ultrasound system for transabdominal imaging. The aims of this study was to evaluate its applicability in scanning and volume estimation of the gastric antrum in humans. Merhodr: Twenty patients with functional dyspepsia and 20 healthy controls, comparable with regard to gender, age, and smoking habits, agreed to be scanned while ingesting 500 ml of meat soup. A mechanical scanner with a 3.25-MHz transducer coupled to a tilting motor provided in 3sec multiple images of the antrum during fasting and 1, 10, and 30min postprandially. On a Unix work station planar contours of the antrum were selected and drawn manually before organ reconstruction and volume computation. Results: Two volume scans of 160 could not be analyzed due to air in the antrum. Up to 5 cm proximal to the pylorus, volumes could be computed in 95% of fasting samples and in 98% of postprandial samples, versus 8% and 75%, respectively, up to 7 cm proximal to the pylorus. We found no significant differences in antral volumes between dyspeptic patients and controls, either fasting or postprandially. Fasting antral volumes in Helicobacter pylori-positive dyspeptics were smaller than in H. pylori-negative patients (P = 0.02). Conclusions: Three-dimensional ultrasonography by use of a tilting motor makes non-invasive volume estimation of the gastric antrum possible without making assumptions about its geometry. In the present material no difference was found in antral volumes between patients with functional dyspepsia and controls. It is possible that fasting antral volumes in dyspeptic patients are dependent on H. pylori status;small multiples, volume, mesh;---

To increase the moderate specificity of DCE-MRI, and therefore, the distinction of benign and malign ant tumors, the tumor's heterogeneity and the tumor's enhancement kinetics have to be evaluated. In clinical practice, the tumor's enhancement  kinetics are analyzed via time-intensity curves after manual placement of regions of interest (ROI). A substantial limitation of the ROI analysis is the inter-observervariability as well as the potential distortion of the ROI's average curve, e.g. if the ROI covers benign and malign ant tumor tissue. We present a visual analytics approach for breast tumors in DCE-MRI data that comprises a voxel wise glyph based overview and a region based analysis. The regions are extracted via region merging and each region contains voxels with similar perfusion characteristics. As a result, we avoid the inter observervariability and reduce distortion due to averaging over differently perfused tissue. A comparative study of 20 datasets was carried out to test our approach and an adapted time intensity curve classification method. Moreover, the influence of similarity measurements and a potential region based exploration are discussed. In conclusion, the presented features as similarity criteria yield the best results regarding the finer classification of the early contrast agent accumulation and the region's enhancement kinetics in the intermediate and late post contrast phase since spatial information is included and the merging of regions with different perfusion characteristics is impeded.;brushing, voxel-wise glyph, regions specification, connecting spatial and nonspatial information, brushing;the local information, that is employed for the merge step during the segmentation process, could be analyzed for an improved local registration.

Gribc et al. \cite{grbic:2010} have proposed a complete and modular patient-specific model of the cardiac valvular apparatus estimated from 4D cardiac CT data using a discriminative learning-based approach. From 4D CT a set of landmarks are extracted for each valve, to provide a measured constraints for generation of the complete heart model.

Valvular heart diseases often involve multiple dysfunctions and require joint assessment and therapy of the valves. In this paper, we propose a complete and modular patient-specific model of the cardiac valvular apparatus estimated from 4D cardiac CT data. A new constrained Multi-linear Shape Model (cMSM), conditioned by anatomical measurements, is introduced to represent the complex spatio-temporal variation of the heart valves. The cMSM is exploited within a learning-based framework to e_x000e_ciently estimate the patient-specific valve parameters from cine images. Experiments on 64 4D cardiac CT studies demonstrate the performance and clinical potential of the proposed method. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time cardiologists and cardiac surgeons can benefit from an automatic quantitative evaluation of the complete valvular apparatus based on non-invasive imaging techniques. In conjunction with existent patient-specific chamber models, the presented valvular model enables personalized computation modeling and realistic simulation of the entire cardiac system.;volume, mesh, combination rendering;---

When the heart doesn't beat properly, it can't pump blood effectively. When the heart doesn't pump blood effectively, the lungs, brain and all other organs can't work properly and may shut down or be damaged. Arrhythmia is one of possible causes of such pathology, and it refers to any change from the normal sequence of electrical impulses. The electrical impulses may happen too fast, too slowly, or erratically – causing the heart to beat too fast, too slowly, or erratically. Gresh et al. \cite{gresh:2000} have created a visualization system, which links together simulation data, measurement data, and 3-d anatomical data concerning the propagation of excitation in the heart.

Boto, Julia Contreras-Garcia, Jean-Philip Piquemal, and Julien Tierny;Interactions between atoms have a major influence on the chemical properties of molecular systems. While covalent interactions impose the structural integrity of molecules, noncovalent interactions govern more subtle phenomena such as protein folding, bonding or self assembly. The understanding of these types of interactions is necessary for the interpretation of many biological processes and chemical design tasks. While traditionally the electron density is analyzed to interpret the quantum chemistry of a molecular system, noncovalent interactions are characterized by low electron densities and only slight variations of them - challenging their extraction and characterization. Recently, the signed electron density and the reduced gradient, two scalar fields derived from the electron density, have drawn much attention in quantum chemistry since they enable a qualitative visualization of these interactions even in complex molecular systems and experimental measurements. In this work, we present the first combinatorial algorithm for the automated extraction and characterization of covalent and noncovalent interactions in molecular systems. The proposed algorithm is based on a joint topological analysis of the signed electron density and the reduced gradient. Combining the connectivity information of the critical points of these two scalar fields enables to visualize, enumerate, classify and investigate molecular interactions in a robust manner. Experiments on a variety of molecular systems, from simple dimers to proteins or DNA, demonstrate the ability of our technique to robustly extract these interactions and to reveal their structural relations to the atoms and bonds forming the molecules. For simple systems, our analysis corroborates the observations made by the chemists while it provides new visual and quantitative insights on chemical interactions for larger molecular systems.;arrow glyphs, topological analysis;---

Absolute and mean blood velocities, pulsatility index (PI), and resistance index (RI) were measured in the common carotid arteries (CCAs) by duplex sonography (DS) and compared with flow-sensitive 4D MRI. Furthermore, 3D MRI blood flow patterns in the carotid bifurcation of volunteers and patients before and after recanalization were graded by two independent readers. Blood flow velocities measured by MRI were 31-39% lower than in DS. However, PI and RI differed by only 13-16%. Rating of 3D flow characteristics in the ICA revealed consistent patterns for filling and helical flow in volunteers. In patients with ICA stenosis, 3D blood flow visualization was successfully employed to detect markedly altered filling and helical flow patterns (forward-moving spiral flow) in the ICA bulb and to evaluate the effect of revascularization, which restored filling and helical flow.

We present the strain rate as color-coded 2-dimensional cine-loops and color M-modes showing the strain rate component along the ultrasound beam axis. We tested the method in 6 healthy subjects and 6 patients with myocardial infarction. In the healthy hearts, a spatially homogeneous distribution of the strain rate was found. In the infarcted hearts, all the infarcted areas in this study showed up as hypokinetic or akinetic, demonstrating that this method may be used for imaging of regional dysfunction.

Hennemuth et al. \cite{hennemuth:2008} have proposed a new method for the segmentation of late enhancement regions in CT images to allow a combination of coronary artery inspection with a viability analysis of the dependent myocardial tissue. (This is really on the edge of physiology, as it is just segmentation method).;#NAME?;hennemuth.jpg;A.Hennemuth, A. Mahnken, C. Kühnel, S. Oeltze, and H.-O. Peitgen;Non-invasive imaging techniques become more and more important as diagnostic tools for the assessment of coronary heart disease (CHD). While CT is widely applied for the inspection of the coronary arteries, the state of myocardial tissue is normally analyzed with MRI or nuclear imaging methods such as PET or SPECT. The effect of late enhancement, the accumulation of contrast agent in defective tissue, is used to assess tissue viability with MR imaging. Studies have shown, that this effect can be observed for iodine based contrast agents, which are used for CT coronary artery imaging, as well. Thus the goal of this work is the development of segmentation and visualization methods, which allow a combined inspection of the coronary arteries and the viability of the corresponding myocardial tissue. We therefore present a new segmentation method for the analysis of CT late enhancement images and the integration with methods for the inspection of the coronary arteries. In preliminary tests by a radiologist, the methods are applied to 4 datasets to compare the segmentation with the reference method, test the combined inspection for data with a known relation between infarction and supplying artery and test the general applicability to patient data. The preliminary results are promising, and further studies will focus on the evaluation of the segmentation method as well as on the clinical benefit through the combined analysis.;bullseye, histogram, 3D view, volume, brushing;---

However, these tools, commonly restricted to close interaction between atoms, do not consider whole simulation paths, long-range distances and, importantly, do not provide visual cues for a quick and intuitive comprehension of the energy functions (modeling intermolecular interactions) involved. In this paper, we propose visualizations designed to enable the characterization of interaction forces by taking into account several relevant variables such as molecule-ligand distance and the energy function, which is essential to understand binding affinities. We put emphasis on mapping molecular docking paths obtained from Molecular Dynamics or Monte Carlo simulations, and provide time-dependent visualizations for different energy components and particle resolutions: atoms, groups or residues. The presented visualizations have the potential to support domain experts in a more efficient drug or enzyme design process.;glyphs, 2D mapping, color coded, brushing, filtering, focus & context;---

The software includes many modules specifically tailored to support the simulation and analysis of virtual tissues including real-time 3D visualization and VRML 2.0 support. All cell and environment parameters can be independently varied which facilitates species specific simulations and allows for detailed analyses of growth dynamics and links between cellular and multi-cellular phenotypes.;animation;---

Hengstler, and Dirk Drasdo;Only little is known about how cells coordinately behave to establish functional tissue structure and restore microarchitecture during regeneration. Research in this field is hampered by a lack of techniques that allow quantification of tissue architecture and its development. To bridge this gap, we have established a procedure based on confocal laser scans, image processing, and three-dimensional tissue reconstruction, as well as quantitative mathematical modeling. As a proof of principle, we reconstructed and modeled liver regeneration in mice after damage by CCl4, a prototypical inducer of pericentral liver damage.We have chosen the regenerating liver as an example because of the tight link between liver architecture and function: the complex microarchitecture formed by hepatocytes and microvessels, i.e. sinusoids, ensures optimal exchange of metabolites between blood and hepatocytes. Our model captures all hepatocytes and sinusoids of a liver lobule during a 16 days regeneration process. The model unambiguously predicted a so-far unrecognized mechanism as essential for liver regeneration, whereby daughter hepatocytes align along the orientation of the closest sinusoid, a process which we named “hepatocyte-sinusoid alignment” (HSA). The simulated tissue architecture was only in agreement with the experimentally obtained data when HSA was included into the model and, moreover, no other likely mechanism could replace it. In order to experimentally validate the model of prediction of HSA, we analyzed the three-dimensional orientation of daughter hepatocytes in relation to the sinusoids. The results of this analysis clearly confirmed the model prediction.We believe our procedure is widely applicable in the systems biology of tissues.;animation;---

VMD can simultaneously display any number of structures using a wide variety of rendering styles and coloring methods. Molecules are displayed as one or more "representations", in which each representation embodies a particular rendering method and coloring scheme for a selected subset of atoms. The atoms displayed in each representation are chosen using an extensive atom selection syntax, which includes Boolean operators and regular expressions. VMD provides a complete graphical user interface for program control, as well as a text interface using the Tcl embeddable parser to allow for complex scripts with variable substitution, control loops, and function calls. Full session logging is supported, which produces a VMD command script for later playback. High-resolution raster images of displayed molecules may be produced by generating input scripts for use by a number of photorealistic image-rendering applications. VMD has also been expressly designed with the ability to animate molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories, imported either from files or from a direct connection to a running MD simulation. VMD is the visualization component of MDScope, a set of tools for interactive problem solving in structural biology, which also includes the parallel MD  program NAMD, and the MDCOMM software used to connect the visualization and simulation programs. VMD is written in C++, using an object-oriented design, the program, including source code and extensive documentation, is freely available via anonymous ftp and through the World Wide Web.;balls and sticks, space filling, ribbon;---

Insley, Leopold Grinberg, and Michael E. Papka;Accurately predicting many physical and biological systems requires modeling interactions of macroscopic and microscopic events. This results in large and heterogeneous data sets on vastly differing scales, both physical and temporal. The ability to use a single integrated tool for the visualization of multiscale simulation data is important to understanding the effects that events at one scale have on events in the other. In the case of blood flow, we examine how the large-scale flow patterns influence blood cell behavior. In this paper we describe the visualization tools that were developed for data from coupled continuum - atomistic simulations. Specifically, we overview a) a custom ParaView reader plug-in that processes macro-scale continuum data computed by a highorder spectral element solver, and b) an adaptive proper orthogonal decomposition-based technique for the visualization of nonstationary velocity fields from atomistic simulations. We also discuss how the ParaView parallel processing and rendering infrastructure was leveraged in the new tools.

The models used in these analysis methods have a number of parameters, which profoundly impact the detection of active brain areas. Also, it is hard to study the temporal dependencies and cascading effects of brain activation from these static maps. In this paper, we propose a methodology to visually analyze the time dimension of brain function with a minimum amount of processing, allowing neurologists to verify the correctness of the analysis results, and develop a better understanding of temporal characteristics of the functional behaviour. The system allows studying time-series data through specific volumes-of-interest in the brain-cortex, the selection of which is guided by a hierarchical clustering algorithm performed in the wavelet domain.

Jiquan et al. \cite{jiquan:2004} has proposed a mapping from cardiac model output of 2D to 3D model of heart from the visible human data. The mapping is based on the scaling of lower resolution LFX data to more higher resolution used in Visible Human Project, and perpendicular rays are generated from the voxel/vertex data of LFX to the more realistic Visible Human Project data.;#NAME?;jiquan.jpg;Liu Jiquan, Feng Jingyi, Huilong Duan, Chen Siping;_x0097_Although 3D heart and torso model  with realistic geometry are basis of simulation computation in LFX virtual cardiac model, the simulation results are mostly output in 2D format.

Keefe, Marcus Ewert, William Ribarsky, Remco Chang;We present an interactive framework for exploring space-time and form-function relationships in experimentally collected high-resolution biomechanical data sets. These data describe complex 3D motions (e.g. chewing, walking, flying) performed by animals and humans and captured via high-speed imaging technologies, such as biplane fluoroscopy. In analyzing these 3D biomechanical motions, interactive 3D visualizations are important, in particular, for supporting spatial analysis. However, as researchers in information visualization have pointed out, 2D visualizations can also be effective tools for multi-dimensional data analysis, especially for identifying trends over time. Our approach, therefore, combines techniques from both 3D and 2D visualizations. Specifically, it utilizes a multi-view visualization strategy including a small multiples view of motion sequences, a parallel coordinates view, and detailed 3D inspection views. The resulting framework follows an overview first, zoom and filter, then details-on-demand style of analysis, and it explicitly targets a limitation of current tools, namely, supporting analysis and comparison at the level of a collection of motions rather than sequential analysis of a single or small number of motions. Scientific motion collections appropriate for this style of analysis exist in clinical work in orthopedics and physical rehabilitation, in the study of functional morphology within evolutionary biology, and in other contexts. An application is described based on a collaboration with evolutionary biologists studying the mechanics of chewing motions in pigs. Interactive exploration of data describing a collection of more than one hundred experimentally captured pig chewing cycles is described.;small multiples, parallel coordinates, line plot, brushing;Scalability, small multiples, new data sources

We adapt particle systems originally developed for surface modeling and anisotropic mesh generation to enhance the utility of glyph-based tensor visualizations. By carefully distributing glyphs throughout the field (either on a slice, or in the volume) into a dense packing, using potential energy profiles shaped by the local tensor value, we remove undue visual emphasis of the regular sampling grid of the data, and the underlying continuous features become more apparent. The method is demonstrated on a DT-MRI scan of a patient with a brain tumor.;glyphs, particles;Extend the glyph packing method to sample implicit surfaces in the field, either isosurfaces of important tensor attributes (such as anisotropy), or distance volumes around segmented objects of interest (such as tumors).

Therefore, studying their properties and changes over time has been in the scope of biochemists for decades. In this paper we introduce a novel approach for the comparative visualization and exploration of ensembles of tunnels. Our goal is to overcome occlusion problems with traditional tunnel representations while providing users a quick way to navigate through the input dataset and to identify potentially interesting tunnels. First, we unfold the input tunnels to a 2D representation enabling to observe the mutual position of amino acids forming the tunnel surface and the amount of surface they influence. These 2D images are subsequently described by image moments commonly used in image processing. This way we are able to detect similarities and outliers in the dataset, which are visualized as clusters in a scatterplot graph. The same coloring scheme is used in the linked bar chart enabling to detect the position of the cluster members over time. These views provide a way to select a subset of potentially interesting tunnels that can be further explored in detail using the 2D unfolded view and also traditional 3D representation. The usability of our approach is demonstrated by case studies conducted by domain experts.;spatial abstraction, visual analysis, brushing;---

The ability to perform a virtual shoulder replacement procedure enables the surgeon to explore the probable and plausible outcomes. Pre-operative planning software assists the surgeon in this complex decision-making process. In our prototype pre-operative planning system for shoulder replacement, we create patient-specific bone-determined range of motion (ROM) predictions based on collision detection using segmented CT-data. The gleno-humeral ROM is visualised with motion envelopes, that indicate the maximum range of motion of the humerus in every direction. The prosthesis placement parameters can be adjusted interactively in our simulator, during which a novel visualisation technique depicts the differences between the current and previous range of motion. In this paper we present a fast and efficient method for highly interactive visualisation of collision detection based ROM for the gleno-humeral joint.

Krekel, Edward R. Valstar, Jurriaan de Groot, Frits H. Post, Rob G. H. H. Nelissen, and Charl P. Botha;Kinematics is the analysis of motions without regarding forces or inertial effects, with the purpose of understanding joint behaviour. Kinematic data of linked joints, for example the upper extremity, i.e. the shoulder and arm joints, contains many related degrees of freedom that complicate numerical analysis. Visualisation techniques enhance the analysis process, thus improving the effectiveness of kinematic experiments. This paper describes a new visualisation system specifically designed for the analysis of multi-joint kinematic data of the upper extremity. The challenge inherent in the data is that the upper extremity is comprised of five cooperating joints with a total of fifteen degrees of freedom. The range of motion may be affected by subtle deficiencies of individual joints that are difficult to pinpoint. To highlight these subtleties our approach combines interactive filtering and multiple visualisation techniques. Our system is further differentiated by the fact that it integrates simultaneous acquisition and visual analysis of biokinematic data. Also, to facilitate complex queries, we have designed a visual query interface with visualisation and interaction elements that are based on the domain-specific anatomical representation of the data. The combination of these techniques form an effective approach specifically tailored for the investigation and comparison of large collections of kinematic data. This claim is supported by an evaluation experiment where the technique was used to inspect the kinematics of the left and right arm of a patient with a healed proximal humerus fracture, i.e. a healed shoulder fracture;visual analysis;

Particularly, this is the case for flow-sensitive phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (PC-MRI) data sets which not only record anatomic information, but also time-varying flow information. We propose a novel approach for the visualization of such data sets using integration-based methods. Our ideas are based upon finite-time Lyapunov exponents (FTLE) and enable identification of vessel boundaries in the data as high regions of separation. This allows us to correctly restrict integration-based visualization to blood vessels. We validate our technique by comparing our approach to existing anatomy-based methods as well as addressing the benefits and limitations of using FTLE to restrict flow. We also discuss the importance of parameters, i.e., advection length and data resolution, in establishing a well-defined vessel boundary.

It transfers the well-known world map metaphor to molecular visualization. Our application maps the complex molecular surface to a simple 2D representation through a spherical intermediate, the Molecular Surface Globe. The Molecular Surface Map concisely shows arbitrary attributes of the original molecular surface, such as biochemical properties or geometrical features. This results in an intuitive overview, which allows researchers to assess all molecular surface attributes at a glance. Our representation can be used as a visual summarization of a molecule’s interface with its environment. In particular, Molecular Surface Maps simplify the analysis and comparison of different data sets or points in time. Furthermore, the map representation can be used in a Space-time Cube to analyze time-dependent data from molecular simulations without the need for animation. We show the feasibility of Molecular Surface Maps for different typical analysis tasks of biomolecular data.;2D mapping, time cube;Contour lines based on the elevation.

In this paper, we propose a new method to use high-resolution 4D CT data to model the complex moving boundaries of the heart walls, accurately simulate blood flow using the Navier-Stokes equations, and visualize the flow in order to view interactions between the heart walls and the fluid. We then visually and quantitatively compare the flow in a normal heart to that of a heart suffering from hypokinesis, and see how the diseased heart is at greater risk of blood clotting.

A mapping between the original morphological points and the newly generated mesh enables simulations of electrophysiolgical activity to be visualized on this new membrane representation.

However, the high complexity of the underlying flow data makes the exploration challenging. For the biomedical research, it is necessary to provide methods that allow for rapid flow comprehension, ideally by emphasizing relevant flow characteristics. Therefore, we present a fast approach that visualizes streamlines in a view-dependent way, while taking relevant flow features into consideration. For this, we adapt a well-established non-photorealistic rendering technique - suggestive contours - for surface meshes to streamline illustrations.

Improved flow measuring modalities and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations yield in reliable blood flow information. For a visual exploration of the flow information, domain experts are used to investigate the flow information combined with its enclosed vessel anatomy. Since the flow is spatially embedded in the surrounding vessel surface, occlusion problems have to be resolved. A visual reduction of the vessel surface that still provides important anatomical features is required. We accomplish this by applying an adaptive surface visualization inspired by the suggestive contour measure. Furthermore, an illustration is employed to highlight the animated pathlines and to emphasize nearby surface regions. Our approach combines several visualization techniques to improve the perception of surface shape and depth. Thereby, we ensure appropriate visibility of the embedded flow information, which can be depicted with established or advanced flow visualization techniques. We apply our approach to cerebral aneurysms and aortas with simulated and measured blood flow.

Our method uses illustrative techniques to provide occlusion-free visualization of the flow. We thus offer medical researchers an effective visual analysis tool for aneurysm treatment risk assessment. Such aneurysms bear a high risk of rupture and significant treatment-related risks. Therefore, to get a fully informed decision it is essential to both investigate the vessel morphology and the hemodynamic data. Ongoing research emphasizes the importance of analyzing the wall thickness in risk assessment. Our combination of blood flow visualization and wall thickness representation is a significant improvement for the exploration and analysis of aneurysms. As all presented information is spatially intertwined, occlusion problems occur. We solve these occlusion problems by dynamic cutaway surfaces. We combine this approach with a glyph-based blood flow representation and a visual mapping of wall thickness onto the vessel surface. We developed a GPU-based implementation of our visualizations which facilitates wall thickness analysis through real-time rendering and flexible interactive data exploration mechanisms.

Substantial efforts have been expended on developing computational models of muscles for the purpose of increasing realism and accuracy in a broad range of applications, including computer graphics and biomechanics. We survey various approaches that have been employed to model and simulate muscles both morphologically and functionally. Modeling the realistic morphology of muscle requires that muscle deformations be accurately depicted. To this end, several methodologies have been presented, including geometrically-based, physically-based, and data-driven approaches. On the other hand, the simulation of physiological muscle functions aims to identify the biomechanical controls responsible for realistic human motion. Estimating these muscle controls has been pursued through static and dynamic simulations. We review and discuss all these approaches, and conclude with suggestions for future research.;---;---

Its dynamic skeleton comprises 68 bones with 147 jointed degrees of freedom, including those of each vertebra and most of the ribs. To be properly actuated and controlled, the skeletal submodel requires comparable attention to detail with respect to muscle modeling. We incorporate 814 muscles, each of which is modeled as a piecewise uniaxial Hill-type force actuator. To simulate biomechanically-realistic flesh deformations, we also develop a coupled finite element model with the appropriate constitutive behavior, in which are embedded the detailed 3D anatomical geometries of the hard and soft tissues. Finally, we develop an associated physics-based animation controller that computes the muscle activation signals necessary to drive the elaborate musculoskeletal system in accordance with a sequence of target poses specified by an animator.;mesh, small multiples, color coded;---

Such methods require constant monitoring by an operator who observes the 3D body motion via its 2D projection onto an ultrasound imaging plane and studies the synchronism of this motion with the respiratory signal. Keeping an attentive eye on the respiratory signal as well as the ultrasound video for the entire treatment period is often inconvenient and burdensome. In this paper, we propose a video visualization technique called CycleStack Plot which reduces this cognitive overhead by blending the video and the signal together in a stack-like layout. This visualization reveals the inherent synchronism between the target’s movement and the respiratory signal, visually highlights significant phase shifts of either of the two cyclic phenomena, with the hope of arresting the operator’s attention. Our proposed visualization also provides a visual overview for the posttreatment analysis which enables educated users to quickly and effectively skim through the excessively long process. This paper demonstrates the utility of CycleStack Plot with a case study using real ultrasound videos. In addition, a user study has been performed to evaluate the merits and limitations of the proposed method with respect to the conventional way of watching a video and a signal side-by-side. Even though the motivation of the proposed visualization is improvement of medical applications that use ultrasound, the core techniques discussed here have potential to be extended to other application domains requiring analysis of cyclic patterns from videos.;time-cycle plot, deformation, comparative visualization;verify the benefit of CycleStack Plot by having it employed in an actual medical system

For a deeper understanding of the complex interdependencies between genes, it is important to bring gene expressions (measurements) into context with pathways. Pathways, which are models of biological processes, are available in online databases. In these databases, large networks are decomposed into small sub-graphs for better manageability. This simplification results in a loss of context, as pathways are interconnected and genes can occur in multiple instances scattered over the network. Our main goal is therefore to present all relevant information, i.e., gene expressions, the relations between expression and pathways and between multiple pathways in a simple, yet effective way. To achieve this we employ two different multiple-view approaches. Traditional multiple views are used for large datasets or highly interactive visualizations, while a 2.5D technique is employed to support a seamless navigation of multiple pathways which simultaneously links to the expression of the contained genes. This approach facilitates the understanding of the interconnection of pathways, and enables a non-distracting relation to gene expression data. We evaluated Caleydo with a group of users from the life science community. Users were asked to perform three tasks: pathway exploration, gene expression analysis and information comparison with and without visual links, which had to be conducted in four different conditions. Evaluation results show that the system can improve the process of understanding the complex network of pathways and the individual effects of gene expression regulation considerably. Especially the quality of the available contextual information and the spatial organization was rated good for the presented 2.5D setup.;bucket view, visual link, parallel coordinates, heatmap, dendrogram;Integrate biomedical data from different domains

They reduce the complexity of the overall biological network by partitioning it into smaller manageable parts. While this reduction of complexity is their biggest strength, it is, at the same time, their biggest weakness. By removing what is deemed not important for the primary function of the pathway, biologists lose the ability to follow and understand cross-talks between pathways. Considering these cross-talks is, however, critical in many analysis scenarios, such as judging effects of drugs. In this paper we introduce Entourage, a novel visualization technique that provides contextual information lost due to the artificial partitioning of the biological network, but at the same time limits the presented information to what is relevant to the analyst's task. We use one pathway map as the focus of an analysis and allow a larger set of contextual pathways. For these context pathways we only show the contextual subsets, i.e., the parts of the graph that are relevant to a selection. Entourage suggests related pathways based on similarities and highlights parts of a pathway that are interesting in terms of mapped experimental data. We visualize interdependencies between pathways using stubs of visual links, which we found effective yet not obtrusive. By combining this approach with visualization of experimental data, we can provide domain experts with a highly valuable tool. We demonstrate the utility of Entourage with case studies conducted with a biochemist who researches the effects of drugs on pathways. We show that the technique is well suited to investigate interdependencies between pathways and to analyze, understand, and predict the effect that drugs have on different cell types.;visual link, closeup;Comparative analysis of multiple paths

Moreover, advanced mathematical methods and theories have arrived the field of fMRI (e.g. computational neuroimaging), and functional and structural brain connectivity can now be assessed non-invasively. Results: The present work deals with a pluralistic approach to "consciousness", where we connect theory and tools from three quite different disciplines: (1) philosophy of mind (emergentism and global workspace theory), (2) functional neuroimaging acquisitions, and (3) theory of deterministic and statistical neurodynamics - in particular the Wilson-Cowan model and stochastic resonance. Conclusions: Based on recent experimental and theoretical work, we believe that the study of large-scale neuronal processes (activity fluctuations, state transitions) that goes on in the living human brain while examined with functional MRI during "resting state", can deepen our understanding of graded consciousness in a clinical setting, and clarify the concept of "consiousness" in neurocognitive and neurophilosophy research.;time curve, small multiples, color coded, 3D view;---

A biomechanical model of the MV, constrained by the observed motion of the mitral annulus and papillary muscles, is employed to simulate valve closure and MitralClip intervention. The proposed integrated framework enables, for the first time, to quantitatively evaluate an MV finite-element model in-vivo, on eleven patients, and to predict the outcome of MitralClip intervention in one of these patients. The simulations are compared to ground truth and to postoperative images, resulting in promising accuracy (average point-to-mesh distance: 1:47_x0006_0:24mm).

More recently, three-dimensional (3D) spatial encoding combined with three-directional velocity-encoded phase contrast MRI (here termed 4D flow MRI) has drawn increased attention. 4D flow MRI offers the ability to measure and to visualize the temporal evolution of complex blood flow patterns within an acquired 3D volume. Various methodological improvements permit the acquisition of 4D flow MRI data encompassing individual vascular structures and entire vascular territories such as the heart, the adjacent aorta, the carotid arteries, abdominal, or peripheral vessels within reasonable scan times. To subsequently analyze the flow data by quantitative means and visualization of complex, three-directional blood flow patterns, various tools have been proposed. This review intends to introduce currently used 4D flow MRI methods, including Cartesian and radial data acquisition, approaches for accelerated data acquisition, cardiac gating, and respiration control. Based on these developments, an overview is provided over the potential this new imaging technique has in different parts of the body from the head to the peripheral arteries.;---;---

Kilner, Tino Ebbers;Background: Phase contrast cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is able to measure all three directional components of the velocities of blood flow relative to the three spatial dimensions and the time course of the heart cycle. In this article, methods used for the acquisition, visualization, and quantification of such datasets are reviewed and illustrated. Methods: Currently, the acquisition of 3D cine (4D) phase contrast velocity data, synchronized relative to both cardiac and respiratory movements takes about ten minutes or more, even when using parallel imaging and optimized pulse sequence design. The large resulting datasets need appropriate post processing for the visualization of multidirectional flow, for example as vector fields, pathlines or streamlines, or for retrospective volumetric quantification. Applications: Multidirectional velocity acquisitions have provided 3D visualization of large scale flow features of the healthy heart and great vessels, and have shown altered patterns of flow in abnormal chambers and vessels. Clinically relevant examples include retrograde streams in atheromatous descending aortas as potential thromboembolic pathways in patients with cryptogenic stroke and marked variations of flow visualized in common aortic pathologies. Compared to standard clinical tools, 4D velocity mapping offers the potential for retrospective quantification of flow and other hemodynamic parameters. Conclusions: Multidirectional, 3D cine velocity acquisitions are contributing to the understanding of normal and pathologically altered blood flow features. Although more rapid and user-friendly strategies for acquisition and analysis may be needed before 4D velocity acquisitions come to be adopted in routine clinical CMR, their capacity to measure multidirectional flows throughout a study volume has contributed novel insights into cardiovascular fluid dynamics in health and disease.;---;---

Cardiac motion estimation is, for example, relevant in the dynamic alignment of pre-operative CTA data with intra-operative X-ray imaging. Due to a trend towards prospective electrocardiogram gating techniques, 4D imaging data, from which motion information could be extracted, is not commonly available. The prediction of motion from shape information is thus relevant for this purpose.

Köhler, U. Preim, B. Preim, and K. Lawonn;We present an Aortic Vortex Classification (AVOCLA) that allows to classify vortices in the human aorta semi-automatically. Current medical studies assume a strong relation between cardiovascular diseases and blood flow patterns such as vortices. Such vortices are extracted and manually classified according to specific, unstandardized properties. We employ an agglomerative hierarchical clustering to group vortex-representing path lines as basis for the subsequent classification. Classes are based on the vortex’ size, orientation and shape, its temporal occurrence relative to the cardiac cycle as well as its spatial position relative to the vessel course. The classification results are presented by a 2D and 3D visualization technique. To confirm the usefulness of both approaches, we report on the results of a user study. Moreover, AVOCLA was applied to 15 datasets of healthy volunteers and patients with different cardiovascular diseases. The results of the semi-automatic classification were qualitatively compared to a manually generated ground truth of two domain experts considering the vortex number and five specific properties.;flow visualization, classification, 3D and 2D;

This is provided by the coronary artery. Coronary artery disease is a disease connected with limitation of ability to provide the necessary supply. Detection and exploration of problematic places on the coronary artery is therefore crucial for proper diagnosis. Meyer et al. \cite{meyer:2008} have developed a more sophisticated visualization of multiple type of data on the surface of 3D model of heart with glyphs.;#NAME?;meyer.jpg;Jennis Meyer-Spradow, Lars Stegger, Christian Doring, Timo Ropinski, Klaus Hinrichs;Myocardial perfusion imaging with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is an established method for the detection and evaluation of coronary artery disease (CAD). State-of-the-art SPECT scanners yield a large number of regional parameters of the left-ventricular myocardium (e.g., blood supply at rest and during stress, wall thickness, and wall thickening during heart contraction) that all need to be assessed by the physician. Today, the individual parameters of this multivariate data set are displayed as stacks of 2D slices, bull’s eye plots, or, more recently, surfaces in 3D, which depict the left-ventricular wall. In all these visualizations, the data sets are displayed side-by-side rather than in an integrated manner, such that the multivariate data have to be examined sequentially and need to be fused mentally. This is time consuming and error-prone. In this paper we present an interactive 3D glyph visualization, which enables an effective integrated visualization of the multivariate data. Results from semiotic theory are used to optimize the mapping of different variables to glyph properties. This facilitates an improved perception of important information and thus an accelerated diagnosis. The 3D glyphs are linked to the established 2D views, which permit a more detailed inspection, and to relevant meta-information such as known stenoses of coronary vessels supplying the myocardial region. Our method has demonstrated its potential for clinical routine use in real application scenarios assessed by nuclear physicians.;mesh, color coded, glyphs;---

Current medical research concentrates on the integration of blood flow simulation results for risk assessment of cerebral aneurysms. Scalar flow characteristics close to the aneurysm surface, such as wall shear stress, form an important part of the simulation results. Aneurysms exhibit variable surface shapes with only few landmarks. Therefore, the exploration and mental correlation of different surface regions is a difficult task. In this paper, we present an approach for the intuitive and interactive overview visualization of near wall flow data that is mapped onto the surface of a 3D model of a cerebral aneurysm. We combine a multi-perspective 2D projection map with a standard 3D visualization and present techniques to facilitate the correlation between a 3D model and a related 2D map. An informal evaluation with 4 experienced radiologists has shown that the map-based overview actually improves the surface exploration. Furthermore, different color schemes were discussed and, as a result, an appropriate color scheme for the visual analysis of the wall shear stress is presented.;surface mapping, color coded, mesh;Annotation, comparative visualization.

While the patient is in the scanner, data is extracted in real-time using state-of-the-art signal processing techniques. The fMRI signal is treated as light emission when rendering a patient-specific high resolution reference MRI volume, obtained at the beginning of the experiment. As a result, the brain glows and emits light from active regions. The low resolution fMRI signal is thus effectively fused with the reference brain with the current transfer function settings yielding an effective focus and context visualization. The delay from a change in the fMRI signal to the visualization is approximately 2 seconds. The advantage of our method over standard 2D slice based methods is shown in a user study. We demonstrate our technique through experiments providing interactive visualization to the fMRI operator and also to the test subject in the scanner through a head mounted display.;volume, surface mapping;

The definition of a BTV requires insight into tumour characteristics going beyond conventionally defined radiological abnormalities and anatomical features. Molecular and biochemical imaging techniques, like positron emission tomography, the use of Magnetic Resonance (MR) Imaging contrast agents or MR Spectroscopy deliver this information and support BTV delineation. MR Spectroscopy Imaging (MRSI) is the only non-invasive technique in this list. Studies with MRSI have shown that voxels with certain metabolic signatures are more susceptible to predict the site of relapse. Nevertheless, the discovery of complex relationships between a high number of different metabolites, anatomical, molecular and functional features is an ongoing topic of research - still lacking appropriate tools supporting a smooth workflow by providing data integration and fusion of MRSI data with other imaging modalities. We present a solution bridging this gap which gives fast and flexible access to all data at once. By integrating a customized visualization of the multi-modal and multi-variate image data with a highly flexible visual analytics (VA) framework, it is for the first time possible to interactively fuse, visualize and explore user defined metabolite relations derived from MRSI in combination with markers delivered by other imaging modalities. Real-world medical cases demonstrate the utility of our solution. By making MRSI data available both in a VA tool and in a multi-modal visualization renderer we can combine insights from each side to arrive at a superior BTV delineation. We also report feedback from domain experts indicating significant positive impact in how this work can improve the understanding of MRSI data and its integration into radiotherapy planning.;slice rendering, color coded, scatter plot, brushing;Mathematical generation of data

These data have a great potential in medical diagnosis, since diseases can be better discriminated and detected at an earlier stage compared to static image data. The wide-spread use of perfusion data is hampered by the lack of efficient evaluation methods. For each voxel, a time-intensity curve characterizes the enhancement of a contrast agent. Parameters derived from these curves characterize the perfusion and have to be integrated for diagnosis. The diagnostic evaluation of this multi-field data is challenging and time-consuming due to its complexity. For the visual analysis of such datasets, feature-based approaches allow to reduce the amount of data and direct the user to suspicious areas. We present an interactive visual analysis approach for the evaluation of perfusion data. For this purpose, we integrate statistical methods and interactive feature specification. Correlation analysis and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are applied for dimension reduction and to achieve a better understanding of the inter-parameter relations. Multiple, linked views facilitate the definition of features by brushing multiple dimensions using non-binary and composite brushes. The specification result is linked to all views establishing a focus+context style of visualization in 3D. We discuss our approach with respect to clinical datasets from the three major application areas: breast tumor diagnosis, ischemic stroke diagnosis as well as the diagnosis of the coronary heart disease (CHD). It turns out that the significance of perfusion parameters strongly depends on the individual patient, scanning parameters and data pre-processing.;slice rendering, scatter plot, histogram, brushing;---

Understanding the relations between hemodynamics and aneurysm initiation, progression, and risk of rupture is crucial in diagnosis and treatment. Recent studies link the existence of vortices in the blood flow pattern to aneurysm rupture and report observations of embedded vortices — a larger vortex encloses a smaller one flowing in the opposite direction — whose implications are unclear. We present a clustering-based approach for the visual analysis of vortical flow in simulated cerebral aneurysm hemodynamics. We show how embedded vortices develop at saddle-node bifurcations on vortex core lines and convey the participating flow at full manifestation of the vortex by a fast and smart grouping of streamlines and the visualization of group representatives. The grouping result may be refined based on spectral clustering generating a more detailed visualization of the flow pattern, especially further off the core lines. We aim at supporting CFD engineers researching the biological implications of embedded vortices.;clustering, grouping, streamlines, glyphs;

The building blocks of the model are individual deformable ellipsoidal cells, where movement depends on internal parameter state (cell size and stiffness) and on external cues from the neighboring cells, extracellular matrix, and chemical signals. Cell movement and deformation are calculated from equations of motion using the total force acting on each cell, ensuring that forces are balanced. The simulations show that the sorting patterns of prestalk and prespore cells, emerging during the slug stage, depend critically on the type of cell adhesion and not just on chemotactic differences between cells. This occurs because cell size and stiffness can prevent the otherwise faster cells from passing the slower cells. The patterns are distinctively different when the prestalk cells are more or less adhesive than the prespore cells. These simulations suggest that sorting is not solely due to differential chemotaxis, and that differences in both adhesion strength and type between different cell types play a very significant role, both in Dictyostelium and other systems.;slice rendering, density rendering, 3D view, animation;---

To understand them in their complexity, realistic computer models of cells may be instrumental and may moreover serve for virtual experiments and simulations of various kinds. We present a modeling concept based on the theory of implicit surfaces that allows for creation of a realistic infrastructure of the microworld of muscle cells. Creation of such models, consisting of hundreds or even thousands of organelles by means of traditional interactive techniques would, however, require unacceptably long time. Therefore, the whole model as well as each implicit object is created in an automatic process, guided by local and global geometric and statistic parameters. To accomplish this, we designed an XML-based cell modeling language. Further, the modeling system is supplemented by post-processing tools for model polygonization and voxelization, and, owing to high computational demands, was implemented in a grid environment. ;Adding dynamic aspect to the model;

Medical 3D ultrasound (US) technology has rapidly advanced during the last few decades and scanners can now generate joint 3D scans of tissues (B-mode) and blood flow (power or color Doppler) in real time. Renderings of such data sets have to comprehensively convey both the relevant structures of the tissues that form the context for blood flow, as well as the distribution of blood flow itself. The narrow field of view in US data, which is often used to make real-time imaging possible, complicates volume exploration since only parts of organs are usually visible, that is, clearly defined anatomical landmarks are scarce. In addition, the noisy nature and low signal-tocontrast ratio of US data make effective visualization a challenge, whereby there are currently no convincing solutions for combined US B-mode and color Doppler data rendering. Therefore, displaying 2D slices out of the 3D data is still often the preferred visualization method.

Based on an understanding of cellular biology and live-cell imaging methodology, we identify three requirements: multimodality (cell lineages combine spatial, temporal, and other properties), symmetry (related to lineage branching structure), and synchrony (related to temporal alignment of cellular events). We address these by combining visual summaries of the spatiotemporal behaviour of an arbitrary number of lineages, including variation from average behaviour, with node-link representations that emphasise the presence or absence of symmetry and synchrony. We illustrate the merit of our approach by presenting a real-world case study where the cytotoxic action of the anticancer drug topotecan was determined.;bar plot, tree view, brushing;Linking visual analysis to the underlying image data

Based on the functional properties of the involved reactions, metabolic networks are often clustered into so-called pathways inferred from expert knowledge. To support the domain expert in the exploration and analysis process, we follow the well-known Table Lens metaphor with the possibility to select multiple foci. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to generate an interactive layout of such a metabolic network taking its hierarchical structure into account and present methods for navigation and exploration that preserve the mental map. The layout places the network nodes on a fixed rectilinear grid and routes the edges orthogonally between the node positions. Our approach supports bundled edge routes heuristically minimizing a given cost function based on the number of bends, the number of edge crossings and the density of edges within a bundle.;network, layout, selection, focus and context;---

Ropinski, I. Viola, M. Biermann, H. Hauser, K. Hinrichs;Closeups are used in illustrations to provide detailed views on regions of interest. They are integrated into the rendering of the whole structure in order to reveal their spatial context. In this paper we present the concept of interactive closeups for medical reporting. Each closeup is associated with a region of interest and may show a single modality or a desired combination of the available modalities using different visualization styles. Thus it becomes possible to visualize multiple modalities simultaneously and to support doctor-to-doctor communication on the basis of interactive multimodal closeup visualizations. We discuss how to compute a layout for 2D and 3D closeups, and how to edit a closeup configuration to prepare a presentation or a subsequent doctor-to-doctor communication. Furthermore, we introduce a GPU-based rendering algorithm, which allows to render multiple closeups at interactive frame rates. We demonstrate the application of the introduced concepts to multimodal PET/CT data sets additionally co-registered with MRI.;multimodal closeups, visual link, connecting spatial and nonspatial information;---

To offer a deeper insight into this data the simultaneous visualization of these images, not regarding their source, must be provided. One example is the field of functional brain imaging, where the activation of brain regions during cognitive tasks is measured. This data has to be visualized whitin its anatomical context - the brain - in order to have an spatial impression of the position of the activation. To that end, multi-volume visualization must be supported. In this paper we describe a flexible framework for GPU-based multi-volume rendering, which provides a correct overlaying of an arbitrary number of volumes and allows the visual output for each volume to be controlled independently. We also present, a visualization tool specific for the rendering of functional brain images, we built on top of this framework. This tool includes different GPU-based volume rendering techniques, on the one hand for the interactive visual exploration of the data, and on the other hand for the generation of high-quality visual representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our tool with data gathered from a cognitive study, in regard to performance and quality results.;volume, color coded, surface mapping, representation combination;---

We were able to generate cultured cells and transgenic mice constitutively expressing the cell-cycle probes, in which every cell nucleus exhibits either red or green fluorescence. We performed time-lapse imaging to explore the spatiotemporal patterns of cell-cycle dynamics during the epithelial-mesenchymal transition of cultured cells, the migration and differentiation of neural progenitors in brain slices, and the development of tumors across blood vessels in live mice.

Santhanam, Celina Imielinska, Paul Davenport, Patrick Kupelian, Jannick P. Rolland;In this paper, we propose a physics-based and physiology-based approach for modeling real-time deformations of 3-D high-resolution polygonal lung models obtained from highresolution computed tomography (HRCT) images of normal human subjects. The physics-based deformation operator is nonsymmetric, which accounts for the heterogeneous elastic properties of the lung tissue and spatial-dynamic flow properties of the air. An iterative approach is used to estimate the deformation with the deformation operator initialized based on the regional alveolar expandability, a key physiology-based parameter. The force applied on each surface node is based on the airflow pattern inside the lungs, which is known to be based on the orientation of the human subject. The validation of lung dynamics is done by resimulating the lung deformation and comparing it with HRCT data and computing force applied on each node derived from a 4-D HRCT dataset of a normal human subject using the proposed deformation operator and verifying its gradient with the orientation.;mesh;Study with more patient data

It lets us understand a normal heart’s morphology and also explains the formation of congenital heart defects. However, learning cardiac embryology is difficult because the processes underlying the heart formation are complex. This complexity is caused by the fact that complicated organs like the heart are generated from only a couple of cells. Heart development isn’t easy to learn because students must understand the spatial arrangement of the anatomical structures and be able to perceive the dynamic evolution of these structures in its whole complexity. Students have traditionally studied heart development through either lectures or textbooks. But none of these teaching modalities adequately describes the spatiotemporal complexity of the heart’s development. To get an idea of the difficulty of such a description, see the sidebar “Development of Cardiac Outflow Tracts.” Classically, the descriptions are illustrated by sketches like Figure 1 that help us visualize or represent the spatiotemporal evolution of this phenomenon.1 However, such drawings and sketches aren’t effective because 2D pictures only give a partial impression of the objects’ geometry. Moreover, the dynamics of structural evolution can only be rendered with a limited sequence of static images. This inadequacy in representing complex spatial developments is a major limitation. As a result, researchers must undergo the tricky task of graphically illustrating the generation and temporal transformation of most cardiac structures. Fortunately, advanced computer graphics can provide substantial improvements for teaching medicine (see, for example, the special CG&Aissue on imaging in medical education2) by letting researchers design, model, visualize, and manipulate 3D objects as well as produce animated movies. This article shows how we created animated models to improve the understanding of the complex changes that occur during normal heart development.;mesh, animation;---

Biologists are familiar with visual representations of metabolic pathways. Visualizations help them to understand the complex relationships between the components of the pathways, to extract information from the data, and to compare pathways between different species. However, visual interfaces to metabolic pathway databases cannot cope well with the visual comparison of similar pathways in different species. This paper presents a new approach for the visual comparison of metabolic pathways using a constraint graph drawing algorithm. Using layout constraints the same parts of similar pathways in different species are placed side by side, thereby highlighting similarities and differences between these pathways. This visualization method can be used as a visual interface to databases and has been tested with data obtained from the BioPath system and from the KEGG database.;network, comparative visualization;---

Linsen;Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Nearly half of all heart failures occur due to the decline in the performance of the left ventricle (LV). Therefore, early detection, monitoring, and accurate diagnosis of LV pathologies are of critical importance. Usually, global cardiac function parameters are used to assess the cardiac structure and function, although regional abnormalities are important biomarkers of several cardiac diseases. Regional motion of the myocardium, the muscular wall of the LV, can be captured in a non-invasive manner using the velocity-encoded magnetic resonance (MR) imaging method known as Tissue Phase Mapping (TPM). To analyze the complex motion pattern, one typically visualizes for each time step the radial, longitudinal, and circumferential velocities separately according to the American Heart Association (AHA) model, which makes the comprehension of the spatio-temporal pattern an extremely challenging cognitive task. We propose novel spatio-temporal visualization methods for LV myocardial motion analysis with less cognitive load. Our approach uses coordinated views for navigating through the data space. One view visualizes individual time steps, which can be scrolled or animated, while a second view visualizes the temporal evolution using the radial layout of a polar plot for the time dimension. Different designs for visual encoding were considered in both views and evaluated with medical experts to demonstrate and compare their effectiveness and intuitiveness for detecting and analyzing regional abnormalities.;bullseye, warping, pins, lines;---

Common visualization techniques show either the whole volume in one time step (for example using direct volume rendering) or let the user select a region of interest (ROI) for which a collection of time-intensity curves is shown. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that dynamically embeds quantitative detail views in a spatial layout. Inspired by the concept of small multiples, we introduce a new primitive graxel (graph pixel). Graxels are view dependent primitives of time-intensity graphs, generated on-the-fly by aggregating per-ray information over time and image regions. Our method enables the detailed feature-aligned visual analysis of time-dependent volume data and allows interactive refinement and filtering. Temporal behaviors like frequency relations, aperiodic or periodic oscillations and their spatial context are easily perceived with our method.

Sundar et al. \cite{sundar:2009} proposed a method for spatio-temporally smooth and consistent estimation of cardiac motion from MR cine sequences. Unlike other approaches, that estimate myocardial motion by performing a series of deformable 3D registrations, the authors instead present it as a 4D registration problem, which makes the motion estimates temporally smooth and consistent.;#NAME?;sundar.jpg;Hari Sundar, Harold Litt, Dinggang Shen;A method for spatio-temporally smooth and consistent estimation of cardiac motion from MR cine sequences is proposed. Myocardial motion is estimated within a 4-dimensional (4D) registration framework, in which all 3D images obtained at different cardiac phases are simultaneously registered. This facilitates spatio-temporally consistent estimation of motion as opposed to other registrationbased algorithms which estimate the motion by sequentially registering one frame to another. To facilitate image matching, an attribute vector (AV) is constructed for each point in the image, and is intended to serve as a “morphological signature” of that point. The AV includes intensity, boundary, and geometric moment invariants (GMIs). Hierarchical registration of two image sequences is achieved by using the most distinctive points for initial registration of two sequences and gradually adding less-distinctive points to refine the registration. Experimental results on real data demonstrate good performance of the proposed method for cardiac image registration and motion estimation. The motion estimation is validated via comparisons with motion estimates obtained from MR images with myocardial tagging.;3D view, slice rendering, color coded;---

Sundaram, James C. Gee;The lungs are highly elastic organs, composed of a variety of structures: vasculature, airways and parenchyma. The unique mechanical properties of each of these structures form the composite material of the lung. Numerous pulmonary diseases affect these material properties. Clinically, these structural changes cannot be directly quantified. However, medical imaging modalities such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging can be used to observe lung morphology. It would be helpful to be able to correlate regional morphological changes with changes in pulmonary function. We present an approach toward the quantification of pulmonary deformation via non-rigid registration of serial MR images of the lung using the variational framework implemented in the Insight toolkit. Conventional registration methods, as exemplified by a finite element implementation of the classic elastic matching technique, are shown to perform well over a set of vascular landmarks in the measurement of lung motion. This performance is maintained in an augmented system, which combines inhomogeneous material properties with the use of domain discretizations tailored to reflect the apparent geometry within the image and to reduce background effects. These adaptations lay the groundwork for biomechanical modeling of the lung using the finite element method.;flow visualization, slice rendering, color coded, arrows;---

We simulate 30 contact/collision coupled muscles in the upper limb and describe a computationally tractable implementation using an embedded mesh framework. Muscle geometry is embedded in a non-manifold, connectivity preserving simulation mesh molded out of a lower resolution BCC lattice containing identical, well-shaped elements leading to a relaxed time step restriction for stability and thus reduced computational cost. The muscles are endowed with a transversely isotropic, quasi-incompressible constitutive model that incorporates muscle fiber fields as well as passive and active components. The simulation takes advantage of a new robust finite element technique that handles both degenerate and inverted tetrahedra.;mesh, animation;More realistic muscle constitutive models that include the force/velocity relationship, time dependent elasticity changes noted in as well as anisotropic shear behavior relative to the fiber axis can be used when examining more specific phenomena on a smaller scale such as nonuniform contraction of the biceps

The results are subsequently visualized using both three-dimensional visualizations and bull’s eye plots, partially inspired by approaches currently common in medical practice. Our approach results in a comprehensive visualization of the coronary anatomy that compares well to visualizations commonly used for other scanning technologies. We demonstrate techniques giving detailed insight in blood supply, coronary territories and feeding coronary arteries of a selected region. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach through visualizations that show information which commonly cannot be directly observed in scanning data, such as a separate visualization of the supply from each coronary artery. We thus show that the results of a computational simulation can be effectively visualized and facilitate visually correlating these results to for example perfusion data.;3D to 2D, bullseye, comparative visualization, color coded;---

Such methods that visualize polymer/solvent interactions on a hydration shell around a polymer are not available in current tools and can greatly facilitate the visual analysis, which helps domain experts to extract additional information about hydrogel characteristics and gain new insights from the simulation results.

Regions that show such correlated behavior are said to form resting-state networks (RSNs). RSNs have been investigated using seed-dependent functional connectivity maps and by using a number of model-free methods. However, examining RSNs across a group of subjects is still a complex task and often involves human input in selecting meaningful networks. Methodology/Principal Findings: We report on a voxel based model-free normalized cut graph clustering approach with whole brain coverage for group analysis of resting-state data, in which the number of RSNs is computed as an optimal clustering fit of the data. Inter-voxel correlations of time-series are grouped at the individual level and the consistency of the resulting networks across subjects is clustered at the group level, defining the group RSNs. We scanned a group of 26 subjects at rest with a fast BOLD sensitive fMRI scanning protocol on a 3 Tesla MR scanner. Conclusions/Significance: An optimal group clustering fit revealed 7 RSNs. The 7 RSNs included motor/visual, auditory and attention networks and the frequently reported default mode network.

Vissers, L. Ferrarini, J. Milles, and C.P. Botha;Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is an important modality in the study of the functional architecture of the human brain. The correlation between the resting state fMRI activity traces of different brain regions indicates to what extent they are functionally connected. rs-fMRI data typically consists of a matrix of correlations, also denoted as functional correlations, between regions in the brain. Visualization is required for a good understanding of the data. Several well-known representations have been used to visualize this type of data, including multi-dimensional scaling, spring embedding, scatter plots and network visualization. None of these methods provide the ability to show the functional correlation in relation to the anatomical distance and position of the regions, while preserving the ability to quickly identify outliers in the data. In this paper, a visual analysis application is presented that overcomes this limitation by combining the strengths of the two-dimensional representations with three dimensional network and iso-surfacing visualizations. We show how the application facilitates rs-fMRI connectivity research by means of a case study evaluation.;3D view, network, scatter plot, brushing, filtering;Visualizing change over time to visualize differences between different subjects

Clough, M. Eduard Groller, Bart ter Haar Romeny, Anna Vilanova;Insight into the dynamics of blood-flow considerably improves the understanding of the complex cardiovascular system and its pathologies. Advances in MRI technology enable acquisition of 4D blood-flow data, providing quantitative blood-flow velocities over time. The currently typical slice-by-slice analysis requires a full mental reconstruction of the unsteady blood-flow field, which is a tedious and highly challenging task, even for skilled physicians. We endeavor to alleviate this task by means of comprehensive visualization and interaction techniques. In this paper we present a framework for pre-clinical cardiovascular research, providing tools to both interactively explore the 4D blood-flow data and depict the essential blood-flow characteristics. The framework encompasses a variety of visualization styles, comprising illustrative techniques as well as improved methods from the established field of flow visualization. Each of the incorporated styles, including exploded planar reformats, flow-direction highlights, and arrow-trails, locally captures the blood-flow dynamics and may be initiated by an interactively probed vessel cross-section. Additionally, we present the results of an evaluation with domain experts, measuring the value of each of the visualization styles and related rendering parameters.;flow visualization, arrows, pathlines, color coded;Other illustrative techniques such as the line perception could be enhanced by means of shadows or halo effects. Additionally, more elaborate opacity mappings could be applied to the presented line primitives, highlighting only the curves that portray certain properties of interest.

Clough, M. Eduard Groller, Bart ter Haar Romeny, and Anna Vilanova;Better understanding of hemodynamics conceivably leads to improved diagnosis and prognosis of cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, an elaborate analysis of the blood-flow in heart and thoracic arteries is essential. Contemporary MRI techniques enable acquisition of quantitative time-resolved flow information, resulting in 4D velocity fields that capture the blood-flow behavior. Visual exploration of these fields provides comprehensive insight into the unsteady blood-flow behavior, and precedes a quantitative analysis of additional blood-flow parameters. The complete inspection requires accurate segmentation of anatomical structures, encompassing a time-consuming and hard-to-automate process, especially for malformed morphologies. We present a way to avoid the laborious segmentation process in case of qualitative inspection, by introducing an interactive virtual probe. This probe is positioned semi-automatically within the blood-flow field, and serves as a navigational object for visual exploration. The difficult task of determining position and orientation along the view-direction is automated by a fitting approach, aligning the probe with the orientations of the velocity field. The aligned probe provides an interactive seeding basis for various flow visualization approaches. We demonstrate illustration-inspired particles, integral lines and integral surfaces, conveying distinct characteristics of the unsteady blood-flow. Lastly, we present the results of an evaluation with domain experts, valuing the practical use of our probe and flow visualization techniques.;flow visualization, clipping, particles;Other types of probe, for example clipping probe, refining probe etc.

Fuster, G. Claassen, and A. Vilanova;Hemodynamic information has proven valuable for analysis of cardiovascular diseases. Aberrant blood-flow patterns, for instance, often relate to disease progression. Magnetic resonance imaging enables blood-flow measurements that provide three-dimensional velocity fields during one heartbeat. However, visual analysis of these data is challenging, because of the abundance and complexity of information. Explicit feature extraction can facilitate the pattern characterization, and hence support visualization techniques to effectively convey anomalous flow areas. In this work, we improve on existing pattern matching methods that characterize blood-flow patterns in volumetric imaging data. To this end, we propose a set of helical and vortical patterns that can be parameterized by a single variable. The characterization performance is validated on both synthetic and imaging blood-flow data. Moreover, we present a comprehensive visualization based on the pattern matching results, enabling semi-quantitative assessment of the patterns in relation to the cardiovascular anatomy.;flow visualization, pathlines, color coded;Parallel implementation, spatiotemporal pattern matching approach

The 4D blood-flow data contain valuable information for diagnosis, prognosis, and risk assessment of cardiovascular diseases, which currently form the leading cause of death worldwide. However, these complex blood-flow data are still rarely analyzed, because conventional inspection is insufficient to extract useful information. Therefore, comprehensive visualization techniques are necessary to effectively communicate the essential blood-flow dynamics. In recent years, the bloodflow application has gained interest in the visualization research field, and new techniques have been proposed to convey the complex hemodynamics. Still, many challenges remain in terms of the visualization and interaction. This work first describes the main applications, and the current blood-flow analysis process. Subsequently, we set out key challenges for blood-flow visualization research, and describe to what extent the challenges have been achieved in the state of the art in this field.;---;

Cohen;Background: Neural stem cells are motile and proliferative cells that undergo mitosis, dividing to produce daughter cells and ultimately generating differentiated neurons and glia. Understanding the mechanisms controlling neural stem cell proliferation and differentiation will play a key role in the emerging fields of regenerative medicine and cancer therapeutics. Stem cell studies in vitro from 2-D image data are well established. Visualizing and analyzing large three dimensional images of intact tissue is a challenging task. It becomes more difficult as the dimensionality of the image data increases to include time and additional fluorescence channels. There is a pressing need for 5-D image analysis and visualization tools to study cellular dynamics in the intact niche and to quantify the role that environmental factors play in determining cell fate. Results: We present an application that integrates visualization and quantitative analysis of 5-D (x,y,z,t,c h a n n e l) and large montage confocal fluorescence microscopy images. The image sequences show stem cells together with blood vessels, enabling quantification of the dynamic behaviors of stem cells in relation to their vascular niche, with applications in developmental and cancer biology. Our application automatically segments, tracks, and lineages the image sequence data and then allows the user to view and edit the results of automated algorithms in a stereoscopic 3-D window while simultaneously viewing the stem cell lineage tree in a 2-D window. Using the GPU to store and render the image sequence data enables a hybrid computational approach. An inference-based approach utilizing user-provided edits to automatically correct related mistakes executes interactively on the system CPU while the GPU handles 3-D visualization tasks. Conclusions: By exploiting commodity computer gaming hardware, we have developed an application that can be run in the laboratory to facilitate rapid iteration through biological experiments. We combine unsupervised image analysis algorithms with an interactive visualization of the results. Our validation interface allows for each data set to be corrected to 100% accuracy, ensuring that downstream data analysis is accurate and verifiable. Our tool is the first to combine all of these aspects, leveraging the synergies obtained by utilizing validation information from stereo visualization to improve the low level image processing tasks.;network, volume, mesh;

This BCI performs data preprocessing (including linear trend removal, 3D motion correction) and statistical analysis on-line. Local BOLD signals are continuously fed back to the subject in the magnetic resonance scanner with a delay of less than 2 s from image acquisition. The mean signal of a region of interest is plotted as a time-series superimposed on color-coded stripes which indicate the task, i.e., to increase or decrease the BOLD signal. We exemplify the presented BCI with one volunteer intending to control the signal of the rostral–ventral and dorsal part of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). The subject achieved significant changes of local BOLD responses as revealed by region of interest analysis and statistical parametric maps. The percent signal change increased across fMRI-feedback sessions suggesting a learning effect with training. This methodology of fMRI-feedback can assess voluntary control of circumscribed brain areas. As a further extension, behavioral effects of local self-regulation become accessible as a new field of research.;slice rendering, color coded;---

Wolter, I. Assenmacher, B. Hentschel, M. Schirski, T. Kuhlen;The analysis of unsteady phenomena is an important topic for scientific visualization. Several time-dependent visualization techniques exist, as well as solutions for dealing with the enormous size of time-varying data in interactive visualization. Many current visualization toolkits support displaying time-varying data sets. However, for the interactive exploration of time-varying data in scientific visualization, no common time model that describes the temporal properties which occur in the visualization process has been established. In this work, we propose a general time model which classifies the time frames of simulation phenomena and the connections between different time scales in the analysis process. This model is designed for intuitive interaction with time in visualization applications for the domain expert as well as for the developer of visualization tools. We demonstrate the benefits of our model by applying it to two use cases with different temporal properties.;isosurface, particles;Mixture of discrete and continuous visualization is still open

Wong, LinweiWang, Heye Zhang, Pengcheng Shi;The advancement in meaningful constraining models has resulted in increasingly useful quantitative information recovered from cardiac images. Nevertheless, single-source data used by most of these algorithms have put certain limits on the clinical completeness and relevance of the analysis results, especially for pathological cases where data fusion of multiple complementary sources is essential. As traditional image fusion strategies are typically performed at pixel level by fusing commensurate information of registered images through various mathematical operators, such approaches are not necessarily based on meaningful biological bases, particularly when the data are dissimilar in physical nature and spatiotemporal quantity. In this work, we present a physiological fusion framework for integrating information from different yet complementary sources. Using a cardiac physiome model as the central link, structural and functional data are naturally fused together for a more complete subject-specific information recovery. Experiments were performed on synthetic and real data to show the benefits and potential clinical applicability of our framework.;mesh, color coded, small multiples;---

Recent advances in electrocardiogram-gated computer tomography technology provide information of aortic wall motion in high spatial and temporal resolution.

The model is able to produce an animation of aorta wall deformations.;#NAME?;xiong.jpg;Guanglei Xiong, Charles A. Taylor;Recent advances in electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated Computed Tomography (CT) technology provide 4D (3D+T) information of aortic wall motion in high spatial and temporal resolution. However, imaging artifacts, e.g. noise, partial volume effect, misregistration and/or motion blurring may preclude its usability in many applications where accuracy and reliability are concerns. Although it is possible to find correspondence through tagged MRI or echo or image registration, it may be either inconsistent to the physics or difficult to utilize data from all frames. In this paper, we propose a physics-based filtering approach to construct a dynamic model from these 4D images. It includes a state filter that corrects simulated displacements from an elastic finite element model to match observed motion from images. In the meantime, the model parameters are refined to improve the model quality by applying a parameter filter based on ensemble Kalman filtering. We evaluated the performance of our method on synthetic data where ground-truths are available. Finally, we successfully applied the method to a real data set.;mesh, small multiples;---

Torres, Thomas F. Campbell;In this paper, a physics-based framework is presented to visualize the human tongue deformation. The tongue is modeled with the Finite Element Method (FEM) and driven by the motion capture data gathered during speech production. Several novel deformation visualization techniques are presented for in-depth data analysis and exploration. To reveal the hidden semantic information of the tongue deformation, we present a novel physics-based volume segmentation algorithm. This is accomplished by decomposing the tongue model into segments based on its deformation pattern with the computation of deformation subspaces and fitting the target deformation locally at each segment. In addition, the strain energy is utilized to provide an intuitive low-dimensional visualization for the high-dimensional sequential motion. Energy-interpolation-based morphing is also equipped to effectively highlight the subtle differences of the 3D deformed shapes without any visual occlusion. Our experimental results and analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework. The proposed methods, though originally designed for the exploration of the tongue deformation, are also valid for general deformation analysis of other shapes.;mesh, small multiples, color coded;Speech production
